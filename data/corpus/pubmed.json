        "text": "Antibodies were prepared in sheep against purified plasma membranes from pig adipocytes. Western (immuno) blotting revealed reactions of the antisera with a large number of proteins in adipocyte plasma membranes but remarkably few in plasma membranes from muscle, kidney, liver, lung, brain, spleen, and erythrocytes. This illustrated the high degree of specificity the serum had for adipose tissue. When injected into localized subcutaneous sites such antisera were able to cause considerable adipocyte destruction, which resulted in complete loss of adipose tissue from the site for > or = 14 wk. This cell destruction was probably mediated in part by lymphocytic infiltration. Subcutaneous injections were of limited use because of the localized nature of the effects, but, when treatment was administered intraperitoneally, systemic effects were produced that resulted in a 30% reduction in backfat thickness in the region of the last rib and a 25% reduction in fat content of fore- and hind-loin joints that resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of lean tissue. Total feed intake, live weight gain, hot carcass weights, and dressing percentage were unaffected. These results demonstrate the potential for producing long-term reductions in body fat in pigs by an immunization technique that may also provide the unexpected, potential benefit of increased lean deposition. This suggests that fat deposition per se exerts a restrictive influence on lean carcass development."

However, it is unknown if seronegative patients develop at least a cellular response that could offer a certain grade of protection against SARS-CoV-2. To answer this question, we prospectively studied 148 recipients of either kidney (133) or kidney-pancreas (15) grafts with assessment of IgM/IgG spike (S) antibodies and ELISpot against the nucleocapside (N) and the S protein at baseline and 2\u00a0weeks after receiving the second dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. At baseline, 31 patients (20.9%) had either IgM/IgG or ELISpot positivity and were considered to be SARS-CoV-2-pre-immunized, while 117 (79.1%) patients had no signs of either cellular or humoral response and were considered SARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve. After vaccination, na\u00efve patients who developed either humoral or cellular response were finally 65.0%, of which 29.9% developed either IgG or IgM and 35.0% S-ELISpot positivity. Factors associated with vaccine unresponsiveness were diabetes and treatment with antithymocytes globulins during the last year. Side effects were consistent with that of the pivotal trial and no DSAs developed after vaccination. In conclusion, mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicits either cellular or humoral response in almost two thirds of KTRs."

Pediatrics testicular MS may pose a possible diagnostic challenge, an issue that is underscored in the few testicular pediatric MS cases reported in the literature. Herein, we report a series of 5 cases of pediatric testicular MS that are evaluated at the morphologic and immunohistochemical levels with correlation with the KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement status. Three patients presented with no prior history of acute myeloid leukemia. All 5 cases showed monoblastic morphology; positive for CD33, CD43, CD68, CD163, CD4 (dim), and lysozyme; and negative for CD10, CD34, CD117, and myeloperoxidase. KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement was detected in 4 of the 5 cases. In the literature, 8 more cases of pediatric testicular lymphoma were reported. Most of them showed monocytic differentiation and KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement was reported in 3 of the cases. In conclusions, testicular MS in pediatric patients shows monoblastic differentiation which may be attributed to the KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement. We also highlight the importance of using an extended immunohistochemistry panel in the diagnosis of MS."

The in vivo manipulation of these activating and deactivating systems prior to S-9 preparation is possible with animals, but not with humans. Hence, the possibility of depleting glutathione in target cells and S-9 fractions was evaluated using phorone, a known glutathione-depleting agent. 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblast-like cells and V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts were used as the target cells, and cytotoxicity was assessed by the FRAME (Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments) kenacid blue method. Phorone was found to have a moderate intrinsic cytotoxicity and to effectively deplete cellular glutathione. When phorone was used in the two-component S-9 fraction/target cell system, its toxicity to 3T3-L1 cells was markedly increased, which suggests transformation to a toxic metabolite. The use of S-9 fractions from animals pretreated with phenobarbitone and beta-naphthoflavone resulted in greatly increased phorone toxicity, which indicates the involvement of cytochrome P-450 enzymes in its metabolism. The metabolism-mediated toxicity of phorone was reduced by the addition of exogenous glutathione."

In the rat and rabbit, the combination of RU 486 and anordrin is more effective in terminating pregnancy than either of the two compounds used alone. A non-effective dose of RU 486 combined with a non-effective or a sub-effective dose of anordrin, or a low effective dose of RU 486 in combination with a non-effective dose of anordrin, exerted additive or synergistic effects resulting in resorption of embryos and termination of pregnancy in rats and rabbits. The serum progesterone as well as estradiol concentrations were significantly suppressed by these combinations when pregnancy was terminated. In the hamster, however, RU 486 was not effective in interrupting early pregnancy, even at a 4-fold higher dose than was effective in the rat, due to the fact that RU 486 does not bind to the progestin receptor in this species. Unexpectedly, there were also no effects of anordrin on pregnancy termination in the hamster even at high doses. It is concluded that in rat and rabbit, the synergistic action between RU 486 and anordrin not only greatly enhances efficacy in terminating pregnancy but also reduces substantially the doses required to produce this effect."

Due to its rapidity, easy implementation, and low equipment requirement, it is well suited for use in rapid diagnosis, food authentication, and environmental monitoring under source-limited conditions. This review will discuss two main research directions of lateral flow nucleic acid tests. The first one is the incorporation of isothermal amplification methods with LFA, which ensures an ultra-high testing sensitivity under non-laboratory conditions. The two most commonly used methodologies will be discussed, namely Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) and Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA), and some novel methods with special properties will also be introduced. The second research direction is the development of novel labeling materials. It endeavors to increase the sensitivity and quantifiability of LFA testing, where signals can be read and analyzed by portable devices. These methods are compared in terms of limits of detection, detection times, and quantifiabilities. It is anticipated that future research on lateral flow nucleic acid tests will focus on the integration of the whole testing process into a microfluidic system and the combination with molecular diagnostic tools such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats to facilitate a rapid and accurate test."

However, an excessive or slight amount of Cu<sup>2+</sup> can cause various symptoms. Therefore, it is necessary for human health to realize the trace and visual detection of Cu<sup>2+</sup>. Referring to traditional fluorescence test papers, the qualitative and semi-quantitative detection of Cu<sup>2+</sup> could be realized by a dual-carbon dots (CDs) ratiometric fluorescent paper-based sensor with the advantages of environmental protection, portability and low cost. In this paper, the inkjet-printed test paper with the best mixing ratio of the two CDs has been researched to maximize the spectral energy transfer of ion detection (maximum color gamut expansion). Among them, the preparation method of b-CDs has been improved, increasing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to 88.9%. The sensitivity detection limit of the double emission ratio sensor was 0.15 nM in solution, and the human eye can distinguish at least 3 &#956;mol L<sup>-1</sup> Cu<sup>2+</sup> in the paper-based sensor. Compared with the traditional single-emission sensor, the human eye was more sensitive to the color change of the emission ratio sensor. The results indicate that we not only realized the micro detection of Cu<sup>2+</sup> with convenient methods, but also provided a promising strategy for the visual detection of Cu<sup>2+</sup>."

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy indicated that the free peptides H1(1-16), H1(204-218) and C(121-210) in low salt buffer assume a random structure but become helical when bound to the oligonucleotide. The structured and unstructured H1 fragments were then analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with anti-H1 antibodies in sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) and with the monoclonal anti-H1 antibody MRA-12 derived from MLR lpr/lpr autoimmune mice. Binding of these antibodies to H1(204-218) and C was inhibited to a level of 50% when these H1 peptides were complexed with (AT)6. When the same antibody was tested with H1 fragment GC(34-210), attachment to oligonucleotide (AT)6 did not influence antibody binding. Competition studies with liquid phase GC and C antigen against solid phase GC and C indicated that liquid phase GC was more efficient in displacing antibody binding reactivity than liquid phase C. The displacement effect of both liquid phase antigens was greatest against solid phase C. We conclude that anti-H1 autoantibodies are directed against an epitope located near the junction of the G- and C-domain which is exposed and not masked when H1 is bound to DNA."

TH-positive cells in the MCL and IPL could be divided into two types. Type 1 cells had one or two thick dendrites that arborized within glomeruli in the GL and often had a thin \"axon-like\" process that exited the cell on the internal surface, with a recurrent collateral that ascended into the GL. Type 2 cells had beaded dendrites arborizing in the MCL and no discernible axons. Both type 1 and type 2 cells were numerous in the MCL and IPL of Rana, whereas only type 2 cells were common in the MCL and IPL of Xenopus. In the GL, labeled cells were numerous in Xenopus but rare in Rana. Mitral cells were stained retrogradely by tracer injection into the lateral olfactory tract and by local injection into the bulb. In no case was double labeling for TH observed, suggesting that TH-positive cells in frog olfactory bulb are likely to be interneurons. Double labeling with an anti-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antibody showed that the TH-positive cells formed a population separate from the GABA-containing interneurons."

Chronic administration of progesterone at a low dose (1mg/kg), which probably could not stimulate progesterone receptors (PRs), inhibited oxidative stress of FSH in gastric tissue by suppressing FSH. Progesterone (5mg/kg) may have been caused oxidative stress as reflected by PR stimulation. FSH may have decreased antioxidant parameters and increased oxidant parameters via PRs. Chronic administration of low dose of estrogen (1mg/kg) inhibited LH and but could not stimulate alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which resulted in oxidative stress in gastric tissue. The higher dose of estrogen (5mg/kg), however, could stimulate alpha-2 receptors, exhibited antioxidant activity in acute and chronic administration. While antioxidant activity of estrogen and LH was blocked with yohimbine (an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor blocker), mifepristone prevented the oxidative stress of progesterone and FSH in gastric tissue. It is concluded that low doses of progesterone may inhibit FSH, whereas high doses of estrogen may stimulate alpha-2 receptors, suggesting that LH could have protective and antioxidant hormone effects."

Since it is possible that the difference between LDL-Ch value measured using new direct method and that calculated using Friedewald's formula can indicate compositional abnormalities of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TGRL) fraction (if VLDL-Ch equal to 1/5 of plasma triglyceride, this difference must always be zero), this difference (estimated remnant-Ch) may represent the presence of remnant or intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) fraction. LDL-Ch is not detected by means of this direct method (LDL-EX, Denka Seiken Co.) in the eluate of the affinity column, which contains anti-apoA1 and anti-B100 antibody, indicating that RLP fraction can be excluded from the assay system. Estimated remnant-Ch correlated well with RLP-Ch, IDL-Ch and apoE. Furthermore, there is no significant correlation between LDL-Ch measured by LDL-EX and Lp(a), indicating that this direct assay system does not include Lp(a) in plasma. Thus, this new direct assay method for LDL-Ch enables us to measure LDL-Ch value with ease and also to estimate compositional abnormalities of TGRL fraction and/or appearance of remnant or IDL fraction without ultracentrifugation."

I is an antibacterial and trypanocidal agent that is undergoing preclinical testing. Unfortunately, I exhibits low water solubility, and it is therefore difficult to prepare the solutions for biological tests. I inclusion took place with 1:1 stoichiometry. The stability constants of the I complexes calculated from the slope and the intercept of the phase solubility diagrams are larger in the less ionized form, whereas greater overall solubility is obtained in basic media."

This augmentation was blocked by an N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor blocker, but doubled by amphetamine. No drug effects were found on the left index finger. The individual amount of cortical reorganization as assessed by mapping of somatosensory evoked potentials was linearly correlated with the pharmacological modulation of discrimination thresholds, implying that perceptual learning and associated cortical changes are controlled by basic mechanisms known to mediate and modulate synaptic plasticity."

Permeation is driven by an incoming ion knocking on those ions already inside the protein. A fine-tuned balance between high-affinity binding and electrostatic repulsive forces between permeant ions is needed to achieve efficient conduction. While K(+)-channels are known to be highly selective for K(+) over Na(+), some K(+) channels conduct Na(+) in the absence of K(+). Other ions are known to permeate K(+)-channels with a more moderate preference and unusual conduction features. We describe an extensive computational study on ion conduction in K(+)-channels rendering free energy profiles for the translocation of three different alkali ions and some of their mixtures. The free energy maps for Rb(+) translocation show at atomic level why experimental Rb(+) conductance is slightly lower than that of K(+). In contrast to K(+) or Rb(+), external Na(+) block K(+) currents, and the sites where Na(+) transport is hindered are characterized. Translocation of K(+)/Na(+) mixtures is energetically unfavorable owing to the absence of equally spaced ion-binding sites for Na(+), excluding Na(+) from a channel already loaded with K(+)."

METHODS: After being treated 3 months or more with nasal CPAP for moderate to severe sleep apnea syndrome, eleven patients (1 female, 10 male, mean age 52.2 years) began a six-month period of supervised physical exercise twice a week, 2 hours each time. Before and after this period a Polysomnography without CPAP was recorded, along with a bicycle exercise test with lactate profile, echocardiography, body-weight, and body-height measurement. RESULTS: No adverse effects or cardiopulmonary problems were observed. There was no significant change in body weight with physical training; no significant difference in either min SaO2 nor mean SaO2; and no significant improvement in fitness. No adverse cardiopulmonary effects or problems were observed. There was a decrease of the RDI from 32.8 to 23.6 (p < 0.05), without a significant change in the REM-sleep portion of total sleep time (TST), NREM sleep, or TST. CONCLUSIONS: A prescription for mild to moderate exercise is safe in the management of sleep apnea, and, even in the absence of a fitness improvement, there occurred a decrease in RDI without a change in sleep architecture."

Peaks in the sex ratio frequency distribution occurred at 1\u22361, 3\u22365 and 1\u22363 (male\u2236female). Hybridisation of O. aureus with O. mossambicus, O. spilums and O. niloticus produced highly variable sex ratios, suggesting a complexity of hybrid sex determination. Few valid inferences could be made regarding intraspecific sex determination from these hybrid data. Sex ratios from progeny testing of sex-reversed males (1\u22363) and most sex-reversed females (1\u22360) provide evidence for female heterogamety in O. aureus. Several aberrant ratios observed suggest Mendelian inheritance of an autosomal recessive gene (F,f), epistatic to the major sex-determining gene (W,Z). Sex ratios of triploids and gynogens support the hypothesis of recombination between the centromere and the major sex-determining locus. Progeny testing of a female mitogyne demonstrated the viability of a novel WW \"superfemale\", which gave only female offspring. Not all data could be explained by a two-factor model of sex determination. Further exceptional sex ratios may be accounted for by rare autosomal or environmental sex-modifying factors. It is concluded that O. aureus has a multifactorial mechanism of sex determination with the underlying primary mechanism of female heterogamety."

However, few data are available on the natural history of the disease, and on the recurrence of thrombocytopenia in subsequent pregnancies. From June 1987 to December 1993, 37 consecutive patients with GT were enrolled in a prospective study, with a total of 41 pregnancies observed. Vaginal delivery was carried out in 33/41 (80%); two patients were transfused fused with packed red cells for obstetric hemorrhage (post-partum uterine atony). Neonatal bleeding did not occur. In all newborns platelet count was performed within 24 hours after delivery: 2 newborns had mild (80 and 75 x 10(9)/L) and 1 severe thrombocytopenia (12 x 10(9)/L) at birth; all of them recovered to a normal platelet count within 10 days without treatment. Twenty-eight out of 3% patients were followed for 12 months after delivery; in 23 a normalization of platelet count occurred within 1-5 months from delivery; in 5 mild thrombocytopenia (100-120 x 10(9)/L) persisted during follow-up. Four patients had a second pregnancy and recurrence of thrombocytopenia was observed in all of them. GT is rarely associated with bleeding episodes during pregnancy and partum, and recovers spontaneously within few months after delivery but thrombocytopenia can recur in subsequent pregnancies. Severe thrombocytopenia is not observed in newborns so that a conservative management is warranted."

The alginate-pectinate beads were chosen as the encapsulation matrix added with different protectants. The beads were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and the viability was checked by both methods. The best combination to improve viability of entrapped bacteria subjected to freeze-drying is made of glycerol 20% (one cryoprotectant) and sodium ascorbate 10% (one anti-oxidative compound). This study also demonstrates that flow cytometry allows assessment of entrapped bacteria viability. Indeed we showed that viability evaluated by plate method is correlated to that obtained by flow cytometry. So, flow cytometry is a rapid method to determine cell viability after encapsulation and freeze-drying. Finally, these beads seem to be a promising probiotic delivery system to target the colon."

Results suggest that oscillations along the theta frequency (4-8\u202fHz) may have a relevant role in idiopathic epilepsy, whereas in PNES there was no evident trend. However, studies were subject to a number of methodological limitations potentially introducing bias. There was often a lack of appropriate reporting and high heterogeneity.

Most previous authors have stressed the role of chronic pressure necrosis or osteitis leading to bone destruction, with primary involvement of the orbital floor.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) overexpression in cancer cells are the two common mechanisms of MDR. However, the relationship between IAPs and P-gp in MDR cancer cells is unknown. We investigated the expression levels of two IAPs, Survivin and XIAP, and their interaction with P-gp in MDR cancer cells. We have found that the human epidermoid carcinoma cells KBv200 and breast cancer cells MCF-7/Adr overexpress not only P-gp but also XIAP and Survivin, and showed high resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin, docetaxel and vincristine, in contrast to their parental cells KB and MCF-7. Furthermore, upregulation of Survivin or XIAP through transfection with the plasmid pECFPN1-Survivin or pcDNA3-6myc-XIAP in these four cell sublines did not affect the P-gp expression. Downregulation of Survivin or XIAP through transfection with the Survivin or XIAP siRNA did not have an effect on the P-gp expression in these resistant cells. Additionally, our immunoprecipitation results showed that Survivin or XIAP did not directly bind to P-gp.

In inflammatory bowel disease the expression of both HLA-DR and HLA-DP was increased, but that for HLA-DQ remained absent, suggesting an inherent defect in the ability of intestinal epithelial cells to express HLA-DQ. In related experiments, an interferon gamma-treated malignant epithelial cell line T84 also failed to stain for HLA-DQ and HLA-DP despite the presence of HLA-DR. Isolated RNAs for all three subclasses of HLA-D were detectable by slot-blot analysis, suggesting that the lack of HLA-DQ expression relates to posttranscriptional defects in intestinal epithelium. These and other differences with conventional class II antigen-positive accessory cells (macrophages/B cells) may help to explain the unique properties of intestinal epithelial cells as antigen-presenting cells."

None of these three variations showed any significant difference in frequency or duration of hospitalisation.

After irradiation thrombomodulin was measured at different times over 6 days in the supernatants of endothelial cell culture medium, on the surface of the cells, and within the cells. At 24 h after irradiation, an increase in the release of thrombomodulin from irradiated endothelial cells and an increase in the number of molecules and the activity of thrombomodulin on the surface of the cells were observed; these reactions were dependent on radiation dose. The capacity of the cells to produce and release thrombomodulin was decreased from 2 to 6 days after exposure to 60Co gamma rays. Our data indicate that radiation can injure endothelial cells, and that thrombomodulin may be used as a marker of radiation-induced injury in endothelial cells. The interrelationship between the dysfunction of irradiated endothelial cells and the pathological mechanisms of acute radiation disease is also discussed."

Transitioning toward circular production systems aiming to minimize waste and reuse materials is one of the means to obtain a more sustainable food production system. However, such a circular food production system can also lead to the accumulation and recirculation of chemical hazards. A literature review was performed to identify potential chemical hazards related to the use of edible and non-edible resources in agriculture and horticulture, and edible plant and animal by-products in feed production. The review revealed that limited information was available on the chemical hazards that could occur when reusing crop residues in circular agriculture. Frequently mentioned hazards present in edible and non-edible resources are heavy metals, process and environmental contaminants, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. For feed, natural toxins and pharmaceutical residues are of potential concern. Studies, furthermore, indicated that plants are capable of taking up chemical hazards when grown on contaminated soil. The presence of chemical hazards in manure, sewage sludge, crop residues, and animal by-products may lead to accumulation in a circular food production system. Therefore, it is relevant to identify these hazards prior to application in food production and, if needed, take precautionary measures to prevent food safety risks."

To more thoroughly understand the physical and chemical mechanisms of this type of sensor, a mathematical model was developed by combining two sub-models: a conductivity model and a thermodynamic model, which gives a relationship between the vapor concentration of analyte(s) and the change of the sensor signals. In this work, 64 chemiresistors representing eight different carbon concentrations (8-60 vol% carbon) were constructed by depositing thin films of a carbon-black/polyisobutylene composite onto concentric spiral platinum electrodes on a silicon chip. The responses of the sensors were measured in dry air and at various vapor pressures of toluene and trichloroethylene. Three parameters in the conductivity model were determined by fitting the experimental data. It was shown that by applying this model, the sensor responses can be adequately predicted for given vapor pressures; furthermore the analyte vapor concentrations can be estimated based on the sensor responses. This model will guide the improvement of the design and fabrication of conductive polymer composite sensors for detecting and identifying mixtures of organic vapors."

At its steepest, the grade was about 34 degrees, requiring long runs of steps cut into the mountain face. The purpose of this research was to determine whether biological and behavioral traits of individual men help to explain household economic productivity to which they contribute. The traits included anthropometry and a new measure of self-paced, voluntary work capacity (heart rate x time). Income per productive adult increased as did the relative fitness index (heart rate increase above resting x min taken to finish the course). However, the number of rice bundles earned per family, expected to increase with more fit workers, increased with the number of household adults and sitting height (adjusted R(2) = 0.392), but not with self-paced fitness markers.

The probiotic bacteria manifested different capacities to adhere to epithelial surfaces, disseminate to internal organs, affect the body weight of adult mice and the growth of neonatal mice, and stimulate immune responses. Although the probiotic species were innocuous for adults, these results suggest that caution and further studies to assess the safety of probiotic bacteria for immunodeficient hosts, especially neonates, are required."

Although it is clear to the authors that a normal tear film resists evaporation, an emerging idea from the literature is that the main purpose of the TFLL is to allow the spread of the tear film and to prevent its collapse onto the ocular surface, rather than to be an evaporative blanket.

The experimental design allows direct comparison between two-dose methodologies, employing one and two (or two or four) equal dose fractions, and multiple-dose methodologies involving determination of the crypt survival curves for a number of fractionation regimens using equal doses per fraction. The two-dose methodology yielded estimates of clonogen number of between 3 and 4 at low delivered dose (single and double fractions each of 6.5-7.5 Gy), rising to around 40 at high biological doses (two and four fractions each of 5.75 or 6.5 Gy). The multifraction methodology yielded estimates of clonogen number which increased from 13 after a single fraction to values of 26 and 22 after three and four fractions. However, the latter values were reduced to 11 and 9, and showed little evidence of any dependence on fraction number, when data pertaining to high biologically effective doses were excluded. Hence it is concluded that the high values for clonogen number typically deduced from such multiple-dose protocols, compared with the generally lower (but dose-dependent) values obtained from two-dose protocols, may be explained at least partially by the higher biological doses generally employed in the multiple-dose protocols."

The interplay between all these factors determines whether nuclear or cytoplasmic exoribonucleases will gain access to and remove the poly(A) tail, which is so critical to the stability and translation capacity of the mRNA. In this chapter, we present an overview of two of the key features of the mRNA life-cycle: cleavage/polyadenylation and deadenylation, and describe biochemical assays that have been generated to study the activity of each of these enzymatic reactions. Finally, we also provide protocols to investigate mRNA's poly(A) length.

Mammary carcinomas in these three groups were induced by dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) injected 1 week after the animals started eating the experimental diets. Phenoxodiol significantly reduced tumour incidence rate at both doses (P<or=0.05).

Compared with the control that was fed basal diet, tumour multiplicity was reduced by 42% (P=0.04) in the group that was fed 50 mg/kg phenoxodiol and by 49% (P=0.01) in the group that was fed 75 mg/kg phenoxodiol. Two additional groups that were not exposed to DMBA, one fed the basal diet and the other a diet containing 75 mg/kg phenoxodiol, were free of tumours. These data suggest that phenoxodiol is an effective chemopreventive agent against DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis."

Adding an artificial tRNA-like structure at the 5' end of cell-autonomous RNAs (e.g., GUS transcript) can trigger its mobility and movement across a grafting junction to distant organs. Based on the accumulated data and the role of the TLS motif in RNA mobility, we built a web server in our database PLaMoM (a database for plant mobile macromolecules) to enable plant biologists to predict and analyze the transcripts they are interested in.

Neutrophils are major effectors of liver inflammation, rapidly recruited to sites of inflammation, and can augment the recruitment of other leukocytes. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been increasingly implicated in severe liver inflammation, fibrosis, and cell death. In this study, the role of NLRP3 activation in neutrophils during liver inflammation and fibrosis was investigated. Mouse models with neutrophil-specific expression of mutant NLRP3 were developed. Mutant mice develop severe liver inflammation and lethal autoinflammation phenocopying mice with a systemic expression of mutant NLRP3. NLRP3 activation in neutrophils leads to a pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine profile in the liver, infiltration by neutrophils and macrophages, and an increase in cell death. Furthermore, mutant mice develop liver fibrosis associated with increased expression of pro-fibrogenic genes. Taken together, the present work demonstrates how neutrophils, driven by the NLRP3 inflammasome, coordinate other inflammatory myeloid cells in the liver, and propagate the inflammatory response in the context of inflammation-driven fibrosis."

After over a century of investigations, the cause(s) at the origin of this uniqueness are not yet clear. The shorter stature of Sardinians appears to have been documented since prehistoric times, as revealed by the analysis of skeletal remains discovered in archaeological sites on the island. Recently, a number of genetic, hormonal, environmental, infective and nutritional factors have been put forward to explain this unique anthropometric feature, which persisted for a long time, even when environmental and living conditions improved around 1960. Although some of the putative factors are supported by sound empirical evidence, weaker support is available for others. The recent advent of whole genome analysis techniques shed new light on specific variants at the origin of this short stature. However, the marked geographical variability of stature across time and space within the island, and the well-known presence of pockets of short height in the population of the southern districts, are still puzzling findings that have attracted the interest of anthropologists and geneticists. The purpose of this review is to focus on the state-of-the-art research on stature, as well as the factors that made Sardinians the shortest among Europeans."

        "text": "Functional high-affinity interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R) contain three transmembrane proteins, IL-2R alpha, beta and gamma. We have investigated the expression of IL-2R alpha and beta genes in immature mouse thymocytes. Previous work has shown that during differentiation these cells transiently express IL-2R alpha on their surface. Stimulation of IL-2R alpha+ and IL-2R alpha- immature thymocytes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore induces synthesis of IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta mRNA. Most of this response depends on autocrine stimulation by IL-2. IL-1 synergizes with IL-2 to induce a 120-fold increase in IL-2R alpha mRNA and a 14-fold increase in IL-2R beta mRNA levels. A large proportion of the stimulated cells contains both transcripts. These interleukins do not induce any differentiation to more mature phenotypes. Collectively, these results show that IL-2 plays a major role in the regulation of IL-2R expression in normal immature thymocyte. We suggest that this response to interleukins may be part of a homeostatic mechanism to increase the production of immature thymocytes during stress."

In this regard, red-emitting materials-such as fluoride phosphors, namely, A2MF6:Mn(4+) (A = K, Na, and Cs; M = Si, Ge, Zr, Sn, and Ti) and XSiF6:Mn(4+) (X = Ba or Zn), nitridoaluminate phosphor (Sr[LiAl3N4]:Eu(2+)), and nanocrystals of cesium lead iodide perovskite (CsPbI3)-have been extensively investigated recently. These compounds generate narrow emissions in the visible red spectral region that are highly perceived by the human eye and lead to excellent chromatic saturation of the red spectra. This paper describes the structure, luminescence properties, morphologies, thermal features, and moisture resistance of critical red components, as well as their limitations for practical applications. This Perspective also provides a basis for future development and scientific challenges in optical research."

Phylogenetic analyses reveal that Hystrix taxa contain two distinct types of genome constitution, despite the overall morphological and ecological similarity among Hystrix taxa. One type of genome constitution is StH (Hy. patula) as Elymus, the other is NsXm (Hy. californica, Hy. coreana, Hy. duthiei, Hy. duthiei ssp. longearistata and Hy. komarovii) as Leymus. The St, H and Ns genomes in Hystrix are donated by Pseudoroegneria, Hordeum and Psathyrostachys, respectively. The donor of the Xm genome is closely related to Agropyron (P). The trnL-F data especially indicate that there has been a maternal haplotype polymorphism in Hystrix species. Based on these results, we suggest that Hy. coreana, Hy. duthiei, Hy. duthiei ssp. longearistata, Hy. komarovii and Hy. californica should be included in the genus Leymus, and Hy. patula in the genus Elymus."

Four groups were compared: three with PD (7 patients with dementia, 10 with mild cognitive impairment and 15 with no cognitive disturbances) and the control group. The qEEG showed no significant differences between the control group and PD patients without cognitive disturbance. Abnormalities on the qEEG were essentially associated with the occurrence of mild cognitive impairment or dementia in patients with PD. There was an increase in the absolute and relative posterior theta amplitude in the groups with mild cognitive impairment or dementia and of the posterior absolute and relative delta amplitude in the group with dementia This study suggested qEEG as a possible physiological tool in the assessment of cognitive aspects in PD."

Intact lipid- and proteolipid vesicles dispersed in aqueous solutions of anhydrobiotic trehalose are vitrified on arbitrary substrates, producing glassy coats encapsulating biomolecules. Previous efforts establish that these carbohydrate coats arrest molecular mobilities and preserve native conformations and aggregative states of the embedded biomolecules, thereby enabling long-term storage. Subsequent rehydration, even after an extended period of time (e.g., weeks), devitrifies sugar--releasing the cargo and unmasking the substrate surface--thus triggering substrate-mediated vesicle fusion in real time, producing supported membranes. Using this method, arrays of membranes, including those functionalized with membrane proteins, can be readily produced in situ by spatially addressing vitrification using common patterning tools--useful for multiplexed or stochastic sensing and assaying of target interactions with the fluid and functional membrane surface."

The idea that experience-dependent plasticity is closely linked with the development of sensory function is still widely held; however, there also is growing evidence for plasticity in the adult nervous system. This article reviews the notion of a critical period for the treatment of amblyopia in light of recent experimental and clinical evidence for neural plasticity. Specifically, adults with amblyopia can improve their perceptual performance via extensive practice on a challenging visual task, and this improvement may transfer to improved visual acuity. Amblyopes achieve this improvement via the mechanisms that have been shown to explain perceptual learning in the normal visual system. It is hypothesized that these same mechanisms account for at least some of the improvement that occurs in the treatment of amblyopia."

The patients' maximum rates of metabolism were calculated by using the two initial phenytoin concentrations and a mass-balance algorithm, and the third phenytoin concentration was predicted. The patients' demographics and phenytoin dosages and concentrations were entered into Phenda, which was used to predict the third phenytoin concentration. The ability of the two methods to predict the third concentration was evaluated by the method of Sheiner and Beal. Fifty observations from 48 patients were evaluated. The mass-balance algorithm had a positive prediction bias of 2.52 mg/L and a precision error of 5.08 mg/L, compared with 2.30 and 5.30, respectively, for Phenda.

Butadiene exposure can occur concomitantly with hexanes, which share common biotransformation pathways with butadiene. To determine the potential influence of hexane co-exposure on butadiene toxicity, the present study examined the effect of n-hexane on butenediol disposition [as measured by urinary excretion of (N-acetyl-S-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)-L-cysteine) (MI level)] and genotoxicity (as measured by the frequency of bone marrow micronucleated erythrocytes) and acute toxicity (as measured by body weight changes) in the rat. The results show that butenediol was not genotoxic to adult or immature rats but was acutely toxic to adult but not immature rats. The results also suggest that n-hexane co-exposure may attenuate the acute toxicity by butenediol in adult rats and that immature rats may be less sensitive than adults to the acute toxicity."

Electrical stimulation of the vidian nerve induced a frequency-dependent increase in maxillary flow, which was due to a significant decrease in resistance to flow in nutrient and shunt vessels. Pronounced increases in perfusion rates mainly occurred in evaporative tissues of the nose, in particular the naso-maxilloturbinates and alar fold during vidian nerve stimulation, while those, for example, of the skin remained unchanged. Adrenergic and subsequent cholinergic blockade left the response pattern of maxillary flow to vidian nerve stimulation basically unaffected. Both nutrient and shunt flows contributed to the parasympathetically induced increases in maxillary flow while responses were compartmentalized similar to that found in untreated animals. Apart from sympathetic vasoconstrictor inputs, these results show that cholinergic and non-cholinergic parasympathetic vasodilator inputs contribute to the adjustment of vasomotor tone in the maxillary vascular bed."

EUG1 mRNA and protein levels are dramatically increased in response to the accumulation of native or unglycosylated proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression of the EUG1 gene allows yeast cells to grow in the absence of the PDI1 gene product. Depletion of the PDI1 protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes a soluble vacuolar glycoprotein to accumulate in its endoplasmic reticulum form, and this phenotype is only partially relieved by the overexpression of EUG1. Taken together, our results indicate that PDI1 and EUG1 encode functionally related proteins that are likely to be involved in interacting with nascent polypeptides in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum."

The appearance of keratan sulfate-bearing fragments in plasma was monitored by an ELISA-inhibition assay which uses a monoclonal antibody (1/20/5-D-4) specific for an epitope present only in the longest keratan sulfate chains. Levels of plasma keratan sulfate rose within 30 minutes and reached a maximum between 24 and 72 hours later. Levels then declined progressively but were still elevated at 2 weeks postinjection. Keratan sulfate-bearing fragments in plasma were purified by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacryl and fractionated by sieve chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B. These plasma keratan sulfate-bearing fragments were found to be similar in size to keratan sulfate-bearing fragments generated by chymopapain digestion of dog nucleus pulposus proteoglycans, but slightly larger than single keratan sulfate chains obtained by alkaline borohydride treatment of dog nucleus pulposus proteoglycans. The results of this study show that measurements of blood levels of keratan sulfate could prove useful in monitoring effective degradation of disc proteoglycans in chemonucleolysis in man and help discriminate between ineffective enzyme placement, and alternative mechanisms of treatment failure."

Such molecular orientation is favorable for the efficient carrier transport in two-dimensional direction in the polymer films (i.e., via both the intrachain and interchain), so that high performance organic field-effect transistors were fabricated with hole mobility at around approximately 4.3 x 10(-3) cm(2)/Vs."

Beyond their nutritional role as the source of amino acids for protein synthesis, they are instrumental in the regulation of food intake, glucose and lipid metabolism, blood pressure, bone metabolism and immune function. The interaction of dietary proteins and their products of digestion with the regulatory functions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a dominant role in determining the physiological properties of proteins. The site of interaction is widespread, from the oral cavity to the colon. The characteristics of proteins that influence their interaction with the GI tract in a source-dependent manner include their physico-chemical properties, their amino acid composition and sequence, their bioactive peptides, their digestion kinetics and also the non-protein bioactive components conjugated with them. Within the GI tract, these products affect several regulatory functions by interacting with receptors releasing hormones, affecting stomach emptying and GI transport and absorption, transmitting neural signals to the brain, and modifying the microflora. This review discusses the interaction of dietary proteins during digestion and absorption with the physiological and metabolic functions of the GI tract, and illustrates the importance of this interaction in the regulation of amino acid, glucose, lipid metabolism, and food intake."

As a result of the fulminant expansion of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the aggressiveness of skin infections, OvEo was extensively studied for its antimicrobial activity against <i>Staphyloccocus</i> spp. and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Moreover, researchers have also assessed the anti-inflammatory activity of OvEo, suggesting its tissue remodeling and wound healing potential. Whereas OvEo comprises important biological activities that are used in a wide range of pathologies, recently, essential oils have shown great potential in the development of new therapeutic alternatives for skin disorders, such as acne, wounds or aging. Furthermore, substantial efforts have been committed to the development of modern formulations, such as microemulsions and nanoemulsions, in order to create the possibility for topical application. The review brings to the fore the most recent findings in the dermatological field regarding potential plant-based therapies involving OvEo, emphasizing the modern pharmaceutical formulation approaches and the cutaneous benefits in skin disorders."

Here, we demonstrate that ATR (AT mutated and Rad3 related) activity is essential for maintaining high chromatin levels of the Cdc6 protein, thereby delaying entry into mitosis during hydroxyurea (HU)-induced S-phase arrest of HeLa cells. Downregulation of ATR (AT mutated and Rad3 related) (i.e., using ATR-siRNA) reduced the protein levels of chromatin Cdc6 and significantly increased the cellular levels of phospho-histone H3 (Ser 10), an index of mitosis. Downregulation of Cdc6 was completely restored by pretreatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Moreover, mitotic entry of MG132-pretreated cells was significantly downregulated. Our results also show that ATR (AT mutated and Rad3 related) kinase phosphorylates Cdc6 at serine residue 6. Thus, this ATR (AT mutated and Rad3 related)-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc6 is likely associated with stabilization of Cdc6 protein, thereby maintaining high levels of chromatin Cdc6 and delaying premature mitotic entry. This novel mechanism likely contributes to the functional regulation of chromatin Cdc6, which delays the cell cycle of hydroxyurea-induced cells to enter mitosis at the S-phase checkpoint."

In this study, we analyzed the expression patterns of Toll-interacting protein (Tollip), an inhibitor of TLRs and IL-1 family cytokine-related intracellular signaling, in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Comparable mRNA expression was observed in murine small and large IECs (S-IECs and L-IECs). However, Tollip protein was only detected in L-IECs, but not in S-IECs. Similar results were obtained in germ-free mice, indicating that L-IEC-specific TOLLIP expression does not depend on bacterial colonization. Next, to understand the mechanisms underlying the post-transcriptional repression of Tollip, 3\u00b4-UTR-mediated translational regulation was evaluated. The region +1876/+2398 was responsible for the repression of Tollip expression. This region included the target sequence of miR-31. The inhibition of miR-31 restored the 3\u00b4-UTR-meditaed translational repression. In addition, miR-31 expression was significantly higher in S-IECs than in L-IECs, suggesting that miR-31 represses the translation of Tollip mRNA in S-IECs. Collectively, we conclude that the translation of Tollip is inhibited in S-IECs, at least in part, by miR-31 to yield L-IEC-specific high-level expression of the Tollip protein, which may contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis."

We used a similar paradigm in four experiments (N\u2009=\u2009112). A fully-visible abstract shape (either symmetric or asymmetric) was presented for 250\u00a0ms (t0). A large rectangle covered it entirely for 250\u00a0ms (t1) and then moved to one side to reveal one half of the shape hidden behind (t2, 1000\u00a0ms). Note that at t2 no symmetry could be extracted from retinal image information. In half of the trials the shape was the same as previously presented, in the other trials it was replaced by a novel shape. Participants matched shapes similarity (Exp. 1 and Exp. 2), or their colour (Exp. 3) or the orientation of a triangle superimposed to the shapes (Exp. 4). The fully-visible shapes (t0-t1) elicited automatic symmetry-specific ERP responses in all experiments. Importantly, there was an exposure-dependent symmetry-response to the occluded shapes that were recognised as previously seen (t2). Exp. 2 and Exp.4 confirmed this second ERP (t2) did not reflect a reinforcement of a residual carry-over response from t0. We conclude that the extrastriate symmetry-network can achieve amodal representation of symmetry from occluded objects that have been previously experienced as wholes."

As an emerging approach being adopted in public health, SS focuses on the complex dynamic interaction between agents (e.g., people) and subsystems defined at different levels. SS provides a conceptual framework for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches that address complex problems. SS has unique advantages for studying obesity and NCD problems in comparison to the traditional analytic approaches. The application of SS in biomedical research dates back to the 1960s with the development of computing capacity and simulation software. In recent decades, SS has been applied to addressing the growing global obesity epidemic. There is growing appreciation and support for using SS in the public health field, with many promising opportunities. There are also many challenges and uncertainties, including methodologic, funding, and institutional barriers. Integrated efforts by stakeholders that address these challenges are critical for the successful application of SS in the future."

One view is that memories are held briefly within a medial temporal store (\"hippocampal complex\") before being \"consolidated\" or reorganised within temporal neocortex and/or networks more widely distributed within the cerebral cortex. An alternative view is that the medial temporal lobes are always involved in the storage and retrieval (reactivation) of autobiographical memories (multiple trace theory). The present study used quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 40 patients with focal pathology/volume loss in different sites, to examine the correlates of impairment on three different measures of RA. The findings supported the view that widespread neural networks are involved in the storage and retrieval of autobiographical and other remote memories. Brain volume measures in critical structures could account for 60% of variance on autobiographical memory measures (for incidents and facts) in diencephalic patients and for 60-68% of variance in patients with frontal lesions. Significant correlations with medial temporal lobe volume were found only in the diencephalic group, in whom they were thought to reflect thalamic changes, but not in patients with herpes encephalitis or hypoxia in whom the temporal lobes were particularly implicated. The latter finding fails to support one of the main predictions of multiple trace theory, as presently expounded."

We present a rare case of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis associated with an accompanying finding of adenocarcinoma in a patient presenting with fever and a cavitary lung lesion."

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a tool by which researchers can obtain quantitative estimates of similarity among groups of items. More formally, MDS refers to a set of statistical techniques that are used to reduce the complexity of a data set, permitting visual appreciation of the underlying relational structures contained therein. The current paper provides an overview of MDS. We discuss key aspects of performing this technique, such as methods that can be used to collect similarity estimates, analytic techniques for treating proximity data, and various concerns regarding interpretation of the MDS output. MDS analyses of two novel data sets are also included, highlighting in step-by-step fashion how MDS is performed, and key issues that may arise during analysis.

Such similarities do not necessarily demonstrate causal links, but instead suggest that specific causes of and metabolic disturbances associated with obesity play a pathogenic role in the development of co-morbid disorders, potentially even before obesity develops. Metabolomics - the systematic study of metabolites, which are small molecules generated by the process of metabolism - has been important in elucidating the pathways underlying obesity-associated co-morbidities. This review covers how recent metabolomic studies have advanced biomarker discovery and the elucidation of mechanisms underlying obesity and its co-morbidities, with a specific focus on metabolic syndrome and psychotic disorders. The importance of identifying metabolic markers of disease-associated intermediate phenotypes - traits modulated but not encoded by the DNA sequence - is emphasized. Such markers would be applicable as diagnostic tools in a personalized healthcare setting and might also open up novel therapeutic avenues."

Moving beyond statistical realities, the paper examines how the UK's industry-led policy approach is shaping practice. Using a multi-sited ethnography situated in Actor Network Theory and Callon's sociology of markets, the UK dairy supply chain policies and practices were studied. Findings reveal that dairy industry policies only partially address the complex network of people, animals, and the environment in which dairy antibiotics circulate. Antibiotic \"misuse and overuse\" in agriculture is far from a behavioural matter, with solely farmers and veterinarians to blame. Instead, antibiotic use in food animals is embedded in complex economic networks that constrain radical changes in dairy husbandry management and antibiotic use on farms. More attention toward the <i>needs</i> of the dairy supply chain actors and wider environmental considerations is essential to reduce the dairy sector's dependency on antibiotics and support transition toward responsible farming in the UK."

CRT homologues were discovered in plants almost 15 years ago, and recent studies revealed that many plant species contain 2 or more CRTs that are members of 2 distinct families, the CRT1/2 family and the plant-specific CRT3 family. However, little is known about their physiological functions. Here we report ebs2 (EMS-mutagenized bri1 suppressor 2) as an allele-specific suppressor of bri1-9, a dwarf Arabidopsis mutant caused by retention of a defective brassinosteroid receptor in the ER. EBS2 encodes the Arabidopsis CRT3 that interacts with ER-localized bri1-9 in a glycan-dependent manner. Loss-of-function ebs2 mutations compromise ER retention of bri1-9 and suppress its dwarfism, whereas EBS2 over-expression enhances its dwarf phenotype. In contrast, mutations of 2 other CRTs or their membrane-localized homologues calnexins had little effect on bri1-9. A domain-swapping experiment revealed that the positively charged C-terminal tail of CRT3 is crucial for its \"bri1-9-retainer\" function. Our study revealed not only a functional role for a plant-specific CRT, but also functional diversity among the 3 Arabidopsis CRT paralogues."

I shall argue that DNA is neither a developmental determinant nor an ontologically distinctive developmental cause. Instead, I shall argue that mechanistic analysis shows that DNA's causal role in development depends on the higher robustness of the developmental processes in which it exerts its causal capacities. The focus on process and developmental system implies a metaphysical shift: rather than attributing to DNA molecules biochemically unique properties, I suggest that it might be better to think about DNA's causal role in development in terms of the causal capacities that DNA molecules manifest in a rich developmental milieu. I shall also suggest that my position is distinct both from the view advocating the instrumental primacy of DNA-centric biology and developmental constructionism. It is different from the former because it provides a substantial answer to the question of what makes DNA causally central in developmental processes. Finally, I argue that evolutionary considerations pose an important challenge to developmental constructionism."

The mechanism of this epidural-associated fever remains incompletely understood. The most likely etiology seems to be non-infectious inflammation caused by an epidural catheter. However, some authors deny this association. They theorize it is caused by selection bias only, as EPA is more often required by women with more painful and prolonged or more complicated labor, where temperature elevation is due to other causes. They point out that in some studies, fever was correlated to EPA only with concurrent placental inflammation. Maternal fever, despite the cause, either infectious or non-infectious origin, carries important clinical and public health implications. Further research that evaluates maternal epidural status and its influence on maternal or neonatal fever could improve sepsis evaluation and lead to worldwide decrease of unnecessary antibio-tic exposure."

Several studies have shown that BRF2 is overexpressed in several types of cancer and suggest the oncogenic role of BRF2. This study aimed to examine the expression of TFIIB-related factor 2 (BRF2) in patients with esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) and explore the relationship of BRF2 expression with clinicopathologic factors, tumor angiogenesis and prognosis. We found that increased BRF2 protein expression was prevalent in esophageal squamous cell cancer and was significantly associated with deeper tumor invasion (P = 0.039) and microvessel density (P = 0.007). Additionally, expression of BRF2 was found to be an independent prognostic factor in ESCC patients. Furthermore, a significant correlation between high BRF2 expression and shorter overall survival time was found in different subgroups of ESCC patients stratified by the clinical stage, T classification and lymph node metastasis. High expression of BRF2 protein is closely associated with tumor progression and angiogenesis and poor survival of ESCC. BRF2 is a promising biomarker to identify individuals with poor prognostic potential and concludes the possibility of its use as a prognostic marker in patients with ESCC."

We hypothesize that using clinical amphiphilic drugs as surfactants to self-assemble with and thus solubilize hydrophobic drugs will lead to readily translational nanoformulations as they contain no new excipients. Herein, we show the first example of such excipient-free nanodispersions using an amphiphilic anti-tumor drug, irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT11). CPT11 self-assembles with its insoluble active parent drug, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy camptothecin (SN38), into stable and water-dispersible nanoparticles, increasing SN38's water solubility by thousands of times up to 25 mg/mL with a loading efficiency close to 100%. The versatility of this approach is also demonstrated by fabricating nanodispersions of CPT11 with other water-insoluble drugs including paclitaxel (PTX) and camptothecin (CPT). These nanodispersions have much increased bioavailability and thereby improved anti-cancer activities. Thus, this strategy, using clinically proven amphiphilic drugs as excipients to fabricate nanodispersions, avoids new materials and makes readily translational nanoformulations of hydrophobic drugs."

In order to test whether milk has impact on skin physiology, cultures of human skin fibroblasts were exposed to commercial bovine milk.

Regarding the underlying molecular pathways, we show functional activation of STAT6 in a p44/42 and p38-dependent manner. More upstream, we identified IGF-1 and insulin as key factors responsible for milk-induced collagen synthesis. These findings show that bovine milk contains bioactive molecules that act on human skin cells.

        "text": "Although it is well known that long-term synaptic plasticity can be expressed both pre- and postsynaptically, the functional consequences of this arrangement have remained elusive. We show that spike-timing-dependent plasticity with both pre- and postsynaptic expression develops receptive fields with reduced variability and improved discriminability compared to postsynaptic plasticity alone. These long-term modifications in receptive field statistics match recent sensory perception experiments. Moreover, learning with this form of plasticity leaves a hidden postsynaptic memory trace that enables fast relearning of previously stored information, providing a cellular substrate for memory savings. Our results reveal essential roles for presynaptic plasticity that are missed when only postsynaptic expression of long-term plasticity is considered, and suggest an experience-dependent distribution of pre- and postsynaptic strength changes."

To gain insights into the biology of MRD, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to malignant cells isolated from BRAF mutant patient-derived xenograft melanoma cohorts exposed to concurrent RAF/MEK-inhibition. We identified distinct drug-tolerant transcriptional states, varying combinations of which co-occurred within MRDs from PDXs and biopsies of patients on treatment. One of these exhibited a neural crest stem cell (NCSC) transcriptional program largely driven by the nuclear receptor RXRG. An RXR antagonist mitigated accumulation of NCSCs in MRD and delayed the development of resistance. These data identify NCSCs as key drivers of resistance and illustrate the therapeutic potential of MRD-directed therapy. They also highlight how gene regulatory network architecture reprogramming may be therapeutically exploited to limit cellular heterogeneity, a key driver of disease progression and therapy resistance."

Studies on the neural correlates of reading in different languages show that this skill relies on access to brain areas dedicated to speech processing. Speech-reading convergence onto a common perisylvian network is therefore considered universal among different writing systems. Using fMRI, we test whether this holds true also for tactile Braille reading in the blind. The neural networks for Braille and visual reading overlapped in the left ventral occipitotemporal (vOT) cortex. Even though we showed similar perisylvian specialization for speech in both groups, blind subjects did not engage this speech system for reading. In contrast to the sighted, speech-reading convergence in the blind was absent in the perisylvian network. Instead, the blind engaged vOT not only in reading but also in speech processing. The involvement of the vOT in speech processing and its engagement in reading in the blind suggests that vOT is included in a modality independent language network in the blind, also evidenced by functional connectivity results. The analysis of individual speech-reading convergence suggests that there may be segregated neuronal populations in the vOT for speech processing and reading in the blind."

Since 1978 lyophilized reference preparations have been analyzed twice yearly by 18 laboratories in the Netherlands. During 8 consecutive trials 20 different lyophilized samples were studied. The inter-laboratory variability of estrogen receptor results decreased with time. Most laboratories found receptor values around the median value of all groups together, though some participants consistently reported estrogen receptor values that were higher or lower than the median. The variability of estrogen receptor results between labs seemed to be associated with cytosol dilution, determination of non-specific binding, concentration and volume of dextran-coated charcoal, and the use of single dose assays or Scatchard analysis. The agreement on the presence or absence of estrogen receptors was more than 98% for lyophilized reference samples with high receptor content. For samples with low receptor content 85% agreement was observed, while 12% of the assays performed on receptor-negative material were reported to be estrogen receptor-positive. The use of the same protein determination (Coomassie Brilliant Blue) and human serum albumin standard has decreased the interlaboratory variation coefficient of the protein results to 7.5%."

We determined whether arterial baroreflexes are impaired during left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) caused by chronic myocardial infarction in the absence of congestive heart failure and whether abnormal central mechanisms contribute to this impairment. Baroreceptors were stimulated in anesthetized rats with and without LVD by increasing arterial pressure with phenylephrine. Lumbar sympathetic nerve and phrenic nerve activity as well as heart rate were recorded. Rats were divided into different groups based on infarct size. Rats with moderate LVD showed impaired baroreflex control of sympathetic, ventilatory, and heart rate responses. Baroreflex gains were inversely related to the size of the infarct. The central gain for sympathetic nerve activity, obtained by using electrical stimulation of the aortic depressor nerve, also was impaired. Baroreflex control of the cardiorespiratory system is thus impaired in rats with moderate LVD in the absence of congestive heart failure. The attenuated baroreflexes are likely due to abnormal afferent mechanisms, although central mechanisms contribute to the impaired barosympathetic reflex."

This study aimed to determine whether muscle imbalances may be used as a clinical predictor for THA surgery. Thirty-six participants were enrolled in the study. Eighteen patients had THA (THA group), while 18 were healthy elders (CON group). Ipsilateral (H/Q) and bilateral (% Def) muscle imbalances of the knee were assessed. THA patients showed impairment of the extensors on the affected extremity compared to those unaffected. A comparison between the groups proved there were weakened flexors in the THA group on both extremities. A comparison of the imbalances revealed a significant bilateral imbalance of the extensors and ipsilateral imbalance of both extremities in the THA group. We computed two logistic regressions using bilateral and ipsilateral imbalance as the predictors of THA surgery. We found that bilateral extensor imbalance may be used as a predictor for THA (Nagelkerke R<sup>2</sup> = 0.22). A decrease of the bilateral extensors imbalance by 8% decreases the probability of THA by 8%. The most interesting finding is that the evaluation of the bilateral extensor imbalance may be used as another clinical predictor for THA."

Results revealed both of oils to possess degrees of antibacterial activity against Gram (+) and Gram (-) bacteria. T. vulgaris EO showed better inhibitory effects than E. globulus essential oil. GC analysis of T. vulgaris resulted in thymol as the oil major compound whereas GC/MS assay exhibited eucalyptol as the most abundant constitute of E. globulus EO. These results support previous studies on these oils and suggest an additional option to treat MRSA infections.

Each group was subsequently divided into subgroups. Of these, the Associate Degree Nurse was the only nursing subgroup which demonstrated role image strength consistent with other professionals. Statistical measures employed were regression analyses to assess unusual individual behavior and correlational studies between three proposed indicators of role image strength. While the population is too small to be statistically significant, data are presented to demonstrate the potential significance in the employment of psycholinguistics as a tool for role assessment and development. The tool is seen to have implications for both nursing education and service in the affirmation of nursing as a profession."

These transitions, which occur in the ultraviolet (UV) at 180-220 nm, provide a sensitive probe for secondary structures. The excitation Hamiltonian is constructed using high-level electronic structure calculations of N-methylacetamide (NMA). Its electrostatic fluctuations are modeled using a new algorithm, EHEF, which combines a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory obtained with a MM forcefield and electronic structures of sampled MD snapshots calculated by QM. The lineshapes and excitation splittings induced by the electrostatic environment in the experimental UV linear absorption (LA) and circular dichroism (CD) spectra of several proteins in aqueous solution are reproduced by our calculations. The distinct CD features of alpha-helix and beta-sheet protein structures are observed in the simulations and can be assigned to different backbone geometries. The fine structure of the UV spectra is accurately characterized and enables us to identify signatures of secondary structures."

In dogs, medial luxations account for 75% of all patellar luxation cases, and are frequently associated with patella alta. Common surgical treatments for medial luxation are trochleoplasty and lateral transposition of the crest to drive the patella into the correct anatomical alignment. Postoperative complications for this procedure are estimated to be between 18-29% of cases, with up to 48% of complications involving reluxation. It was previously hypothesized that in cases of medial luxation involving patella alta, the addition of a distal component to the lateral tibial crest transposition will result in repositioning of the patella into its proper position in the trochlear groove, thus reducing the recurrence of luxation. We performed this modified procedure on 14 dogs (17 limbs) that were suffering from medial luxation combined with patella alta, and our results led to favourable clinical outcomes. This modified surgical procedure places the patella into a more normal proximo-distal anatomical position, is simple to perform, and may become common practice for surgical treatment of medial patellar luxation with an alta component."

The present study was designed to analyze the synchronous and metachronous tumors developed among GIST patients assessed by our institution for GIST Syndrome setting recognition. Patients (n=141) with primary GIST (77 men and 64 women) were recruited between 1988 and 2007 and their clinical and pathological records were reviewed. Mutation analysis of KIT, PDGFRA, NF1 and MMR genes was performed on somatic and peripheral blood DNA. GISTs occurred associated with other primary malignancies in 46 of 141 (32.6%) patients. The most common neoplasms were gastrointestinal and genitourinary. A novel exon 6 germline large deletion of NF1 was identified in the NF1/GIST kindred. The development of GIST associated with other neoplasms is common and diagnosis of peculiar benign associated-neoplasms warrants the search for familial cancer susceptibility.

AMPA receptors are tetrameric assemblies composed from four possible subunits (GluR1-4). In hippocampal pyramidal cells, AMPA receptors are heteromeric receptors containing the GluR2 subunit and either GluR1 or GluR3. It is generally accepted that the trafficking of GluR1/GluR2 receptors to synapses requires activity, whereas GluR2/GluR3 receptors traffic constitutively. It has been suggested that the trafficking is governed by the cytoplasmic C termini of the subunits. Because the basis for this theory relied on the introduction of unnatural, homomeric, calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, we have used the GluR2(-/-) knock out mouse to determine whether the expression of mutated forms of GluR2 can rescue WT synaptic responses. We find that GluR2, lacking its entire C terminus, or a GluR2 chimera containing the C terminus of GluR1, is capable of trafficking to the synapse in the absence of activity. These findings suggest that the GluR2 C terminus is not required for GluR2 synaptic insertion."

These three approaches were used to assess problem-solving ability in a sample of 20 patients with unipolar major depressive disorder, who were treated with antidepressant medication alone at a hospital out-patient clinic. It was found that baseline deficits in problem-solving skills were significantly associated with prognosis at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Self-ratings of perceived self-control and confidence rather than subjective problem-solving effectiveness were important predictors of final outcome. Differences in perceived and actual problem-solving ability emerged over time. The reasons for these differences in subjective and observer assessments are unclear. The data appear to demonstrate that problem-solving deficits in depression represent both state and trait phenomena."

Therefore, the aim of study was to investigate how oxytetracycline (OTC) influences bacteria and acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens under varying operational conditions in OTC-medicated and non-medicated anaerobic cow manure digesters. Concentrations of OTC and its metabolites throughout the anaerobic digestion were determined using ultraviolet-high-performance liquid chromatography (UV-HPLC) and tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), respectively. Fluorescent in situ hybridization, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, cloning, and sequencing analyses were used to monitor changes in microbial community structures. According to the results of analytical and molecular approaches, operating conditions highly influence active microbial community dynamics and associate with biogas production and elimination of OTC and its metabolites during anaerobic digestion of cow manure in the presence of an average initial concentration of 2.2\u00a0mg OTC/L. The impact of operating conditions has a drastic effect on acetoclastic methanogens than hydrogenotrophic methanogens and bacteria."

The movement and the associated agonist and antagonist EMG activities were analysed. On the basis of the topography of the cerebellar lesion, our patients were divided into three groups. In the first group including five patients, lesions involved the efferent dentato-thalamo-cortical pathway and hypometria was associated with an imbalance between the rate of rise of the agonist EMG activity and the rate of rise of the antagonist EMG activity. In the three patients of group II, lesions were located at the level of the middle cerebellar peduncle, disrupting the crossed ponto-cerebellar projections. In these patients, the intensity of the agonist EMG activity was reduced and the duration of the antagonist EMG activity was increased. In the third group including seven patients presenting either a diffuse cerebellar atrophy or a stroke involving a large parenchymatous area, the agonist-antagonist EMG pattern showed a prolongation of the duration of the antagonist burst. Our results show that discrete mechanisms of cerebellar hypometria are associated with different anatomical lesions."

The Biomic category agreement for 3,117 Gram-negative bacteria was 98.4%, with 1.4% minor and 0.2% major discrepancies. The Biomic category agreement for 5,233 Gram-positive bacteria was 98.7%, with 0.9% minor, 0.3% major, and 0.1% very major errors. Essential agreement, defined as Biomic results that were within \u00b11 2-fold dilution of the MicroScan results, was 99.3% for Gram-negative bacteria and 98.3% for Gram-positive bacteria. Biomic reading of MicroScan identification panels provided an overall agreement (first- and second-choice organism match) of 99.5% with 846 Gram-negative isolates and 99.5% with 430 Gram-positive isolates. These results suggest that the Biomic automated reader can provide accurate reading of MicroScan panels and has the capability of a visual panel read for manual adjustment of results."

In both muscles lower doses (0.25 to 10 mg intra-arterially) potentiated and higher doses (10 mg and above) depressed twitches produced by indirect stimulation. Similar effects were obtained in directly stimulated muscles.3. The effects of the drug on muscles stimulated repetitively were dependent on both dose and frequency of stimulation. Doses which potentiated twitches also potentiated low frequency tetani (5-30 Hz for soleus; 10-50 Hz for FHL). There was a depression and non-maintenance of higher frequency tetani (80 Hz and above for soleus; 150 Hz and above for FHL).4. Both atropine and caramiphen had similar dose dependent potentiating and depressant actions. Hyoscine acted similarly in some cats; in others it had only a depressant action.5. It is suggested that the potentiating actions of PMCG, caramiphen, atropine and hyoscine are due to a direct musculotropic action. The depressant actions resulting from higher doses are due, in part, to a curare-like action and in part to a direct action on the muscle fibres."

Although numerous synthetic retinoids have been synthesized, their biological activities are usually associated with clinical disadvantages such as toxicity and teratogenicity. Retinoids that bind to both the retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor subtypes have shown clinical activity in hematologic malignancies and can mediate genes associated with both growth and differentiation. Retinoid X receptor-specific rexinoids have also shown efficacy in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, but their exact mechanism of action is unclear.

We hypothesized that the adjuvant-induced inflammation is attributed to upregulation of activating transcript factor 6 (ATF6; a chaperone for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress), p66Shc (an adaptive protein modulating oxidative stress), and NADPH oxidase subunits p22phox and gp91phox in the inflamed tissues. Biomarkers were measured in the rat paw in association with monitoring swellings. The primary inflammatory edema of the injected paw occurred rapidly and sustained over a couple of days, and the secondary inflammation developed 2\u00a0weeks later. The inflammatory edema was accompanied by upregulation of cytokines including ATF6, p66Shc, p22phox, gp91phox, and MMP-2 and an increase in ratio of p-Akt/Akt in the afflicted paw. These were suppressed by either argirein and rhein or ibuprofen. These findings indicate that ER stress, upregulated p66Shc, and phosphorylated Akt are actively implicated in the inflammatory zone caused by adjuvant injection. These biomarkers were causal factors responsible for inflammation of the afflicted paw and were suppressed by a supermolecule argirein and rhein, and the anti-inflammatory activities of the two compounds were comparable to that of ibuprofen."

The metal removal was rapid, with more than 90% of total biosorption taking place in 30 min, and equilibrium was attained in 45 min. The maximum metal loading capacity of the alga was 303 mg/g. Within the temperature range studied (15-55 degrees C), there was no significant change in biosorption, under optimal conditions. Adsorption process could be well defined by both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms with r(2) of 0.94 and 0.96, respectively. The kinetic data fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetic model with the r(2) value of 0.99. At a low pH of 2.5, where most of the biomasses show either no or less metal uptake, a good (>15%) metal loading capacity of 25% was achieved.

In addition to neat plastic oil, three blends (PO25, PO50 and PO75) were prepared on a volumetric basis and the engine was able to run on neat plastic oil. Brake thermal efficiency of blends was lower compared to diesel, but PO25 showed similar performance to that of diesel. The emissions were reduced considerably while using blends when compared to neat plastic oil. The smoke and NOX were reduced by 22% and 17.8% respectively for PO25 than that of plastic oil."

However, little is known about its immunological characteristics. In this study, we investigated the hypo-responsiveness of MLN CD4(+) T cells, comparing them with spleen CD4(+) T cells. MLN CD4(+) T cells were hypo-proliferative and expressed low levels of Th1-type cytokines in response to antigen or CD3/T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. The hypo-responsiveness of MLN CD4(+) T cells is linked neither with changes in the regulatory T cell population (CD4(+)CD25(+), CD4(+)Foxp3(+)) nor the apoptotic population. Rather, MLN CD4(+) T cells showed deformity of T cell:APC conjugation and reduced expression of TCR signaling molecules such as CD3zeta, PLC-gamma1, PKC-theta, Zap70, with reduced phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). Among the alterations in TCR signaling molecules, defective CD3zeta expression is the most evident, and reversal of the anergic state by CD3/CD28 costimulation restored CD3zeta expression levels. Collectively, we suggest that reduced CD3zeta expression and defects in TCR signaling mediate the anergy state of MLN CD4(+) T cells, which play a critical role in maintenance of mucosal tolerance in gut-associated lymphoid tissue."

However, considerable new data have been derived in the area of limitation of myocardial infarct size. Several studies suggest that the early administration of beta-blockers or intravenous nitroglycerin may benefit patients with acute infarction. We must seriously consider whether the data supporting the use of these agents justify a recommendation that they be used routinely for patients with acute infarction. The role of thrombolytic agents, although widely used already, must also be addressed as data supporting its use build. Additionally, there are suggestive data that the aggressive treatment of hypertension is beneficial, and this approach may well merit advocacy. The prophylactic use of lidocaine and the ubiquitous use of nitrates necessitate reevaluation, although presently both agents are widely used.

For filipin and amphotericin B association with sterols in vesicles, a preferential interaction was found with sterols whose side chain length is close to that of cholesterol. Introduction of trans double bonds into the sterol side chain did not alter the rate of interaction in vesicles. The delta 7-bond of the sterol appears to be of critical importance in amphotericin B-sterol interaction, whereas the delta 5-bond is not essential. These observations are relevant to the well-known effects of amphotericin B on cell membranes containing ergosterol compared with those containing cholesterol. The dependence of the rates of sterol-polyene antibiotic interaction on the phospholipid composition of the vesicles indicates that phospholipid vesicles may be an inadequate model for reaching a comprehensive understanding of the effects exerted on biological membranes by these agents."

In this report, a HPAI H5N1 strain (A/chicken/Egypt/Fadllah-7/2014) was detected from a vaccinated flock showing clinical signs of infection. Genetic characterization of the isolate indicated a high level of nucleotide identity (95-98%) with variant and classical groups of H5N1. Moreover, multiple-nucleotide and amino acid alignments revealed several prominent and characteristic substitutions in the surface glycoprotein, which may have biological relevance to the pathobiology of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the reported isolate closely relates to H5N1 AIVs subclade 2.2.1.1 in spite of no reports of this subclade since 2011 from AI reported cases in Egyptian avian species. In conclusion, our results highlight the re-emergence of a novel H5N1 AIV variant subclade 2.2.1.1 that could escape immunity induced by vaccines. This discovery illustrates the importance of continuous monitoring of poultry in this country for controlling AIV including identifying sources of vaccine seed viruses."

In the growth plate and developing neonate bones, LIF deficiency enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, enlarged blood vessel formation, and increased the formation of \"giant\" osteoclasts/chondroclasts that rapidly destroyed the mineralized regions of the growth plate and developing neonatal bone. Below this region, osteoblasts formed large quantities of woven bone. In contrast, in adult bone undergoing remodeling osteoclast formation was unaffected by LIF deficiency, whereas osteoblast formation and function were both significantly impaired, resulting in osteopenia. Consistent with LIF promoting osteoblast commitment, enhanced marrow adipocyte formation was also observed in adult LIF null mice, and adipocytic differentiation of murine stromal cells was delayed by LIF treatment. LIF, therefore, controls vascular size and osteoclast differentiation during the transition of cartilage to bone, whereas an anatomically separate LIF-dependent pathway regulates osteoblast and adipocyte commitment in bone remodeling."

A total of 120 roots were distributed into 4 groups according to the irrigant used in root canal preparation: 1% PAA (PAA); 2.5% NaOCl followed by final irrigation with 17% EDTA and 2.5% NaOCl (NaOCl-EDTA-NaOCl); 2.5% NaOCl (NaOCl); and saline solution (SS). The smear layer was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. The bond strength of an epoxy-based resin sealer (AH Plus) to root dentin was evaluated by the push-out test and penetrability of the sealer into dentinal tubules was observed by confocal laser microscopy. The results were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis and the Dunn post-test (\u03b1 = 0.05). The use of 1% PAA as single root canal irrigant provided smear layer removal and improved the penetrability and bond strength of AH Plus to root dentin in a manner similar to that of the NaOCl-EDTA-NaOCl group (p > 0.05). The NaOCl and SS groups had higher values of smear layer and lower values of sealer penetrability and dentin bond strength than the PAA and NaOCl-EDTA-NaOCl groups (p < 0.05). Thus, 1% PAA has the potential to be used as a single irrigant in root canals."

Because of HCC's high heterogeneity, it has been suggested that multiple biomarkers would be needed to develop a sensitive HCC screening test. This study applied random forest (RF), a machine learning technique, and proposed two novel models, fixed sequential (FS) and two-step (TS), for comparison with two commonly used statistical techniques, logistic regression (LR) and classification and regression trees (CART), in combining multiple urine DNA biomarkers for HCC screening using biomarker values obtained from 137 HCC and 431 non-HCC (224 hepatitis and 207 cirrhosis) subjects. The sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating curve, and variability were estimated through repeated 10-fold cross-validation to compare the models' performances in accuracy and robustness. We show that RF and TS have higher accuracy and stability; specifically, they reach 90% specificity and 86%/87% sensitivity respectively along with 15% higher sensitivity and 10% higher specificity than LR in cross-validation. The potential of RF and TS to develop a panel of multiple biomarkers and the possibility for self-training, cloud-based models for HCC screening are discussed."

Herein, phonon thermal transport across multilayer Gr/h-BN vdW heterostructures was systematically investigated by extensive molecular dynamics simulations, both in terms of internal structural configuration and external modulation. The former includes the structural configuration at the Gr/h-BN interface, the proportion of components in the effective heat transfer area, and size effect, while the latter includes cross-plane strain, temperature, and interfacial coupling strength. Our results show that at 300 K it has an ultralow out-of-plane thermal conductivity of only about 8.93 MWm<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, while the Gr/h-BN interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) is up to about 300 MWm<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, and the latter can be modulated in a wide range from 0.5 to 3.5 times under cross-plane strain. The analysis of the spectral decomposition results indicates that the thermal transport across the Gr/h-BN interface depends almost entirely on low-frequency out-of-plane phonons below 10 THz and the quantum effect can be ignorable, which uncovers the physical mechanisms underlying the changes in the ITC and also points the path toward its modulation."

Co-activation was applied to the index, middle and ring fingers of the right hand either synchronously or asynchronously. Cortical representations for synchronously co-activated fingers moved closer together, whereas cortical representations for asynchronously co-activated fingers became segregated. Behaviorally, this pattern coincided with an increased and reduced number of mislocalizations between synchronously and asynchronously co-activated fingers, respectively. Thus, both synchronous and asynchronous coupling of passive tactile stimulation is able to induce short-term cortical reorganization associated with functionally relevant changes."

These changes were accompanied by a significantly increased flow rate and percentage distribution of flow through the juxtameduallary circulation. 3. In a further five baboons treated in the same way, various doses of noradrenaline were infused into the renal artery. In these animals there was an enhanced pressor response to noradrenaline, and this effect was completely abolished by an alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking agent (phenoxybenzamine). The beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug (propranolol) had no such effect. 4. This enhanced response was not seen when noradrenaline was infused into three sham-operated baboons. 5.

No microbubbles were produced, since there was no artificial blood/air interface. Complement activation, as assessed by amount of white-cell sequestration in the lungs, was also lower than that reported in other forms of bypass. There were no major complications attributable to the technique.

Recent mobility challenges led NASA Johnson Space Center to develop a prototype robotic lunar rover Resource Prospector 15 (RP15) capable of wheeled, legged, and crawling behavior. To systematically understand the terradynamic performance of such a device, we developed a scaled-down rover robot and studied its locomotion on slopes of dry and wet granular media. Addition of a cyclic-legged gait to the robot's wheel spinning action changes the robot dynamics from that of a wheeled vehicle to a locomotor paddling through frictional fluid. Granular drag force measurements and modified resistive force theory facilitate modeling of such dynamics. A peculiar gait strategy that agitates and cyclically reflows grains under the robot allows it to \"swim\" up loosely consolidated hills. Whereas substrate disturbance typically hinders locomotion in granular media, the multimode design of RP15 and a diversity of possible gaits facilitate formation of self-organized localized frictional fluids that enable effective robust transport."

In contrast to prior expectations, we found 102 (94%) to be active enhancers during embryogenesis and to display diverse spatial and temporal patterns, reminiscent of expression patterns for important developmental genes. Remarkably, HOT regions strongly activate nearby genes and are required for endogenous gene expression, as we show using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenesis. HOT enhancers have a distinct cis-regulatory signature with enriched sequence motifs for the global activators Vielfaltig, also known as Zelda, and Trithorax-like, also known as GAGA.

This question was addressed in two situations contrasting the dynamics of engagement of reconfiguration processes (reactive vs. proactive). A cued task-switching paradigm was presented to kindergartners and fourth graders, who are known to differ in their preferential mode of control engagement. Flexibility adaptation was examined through the modulation of switching costs by switch proportion, the so-called list-wide switch proportion (LWSP) effect. When the situation forced the use of reactive control (Experiment 1: simultaneous presentation of the cue and the stimulus), we found the LWSP effect with a greater magnitude in kindergartners than in fourth graders. In the situation inducing proactive control (Experiment 2: task cue presented before and until the stimulus), flexibility adaptation was obtained when error rates were considered but not response times. By demonstrating that even young children are capable of flexibility adaptation to contextual demands, these findings support the hypothesis that implicitly triggered adaptation of control may develop as early as the end of the preschool years despite the immaturity of cognitive control during this period."

The iron-overloaded mice subsequently received a vehicle, DFP, NAC, or DFP plus NAC co-therapy. In both WT and HT iron-overloaded mice, DFP and NAC had similar efficacy in decreasing plasma non-transferrin-bound iron, decreasing cardiac iron concentration (CIC) and relieving systolic dysfunction. DFP plus NAC co-therapy, however, was better than the monotherapy in reducing CIC and restoring cardiac [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient amplitude and rising rate. All regimens produced no change in cardiac Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulatory protein expression. We provided the first evidence regarding the synergistic effect of combined iron chelator-antioxidant therapy on cardiac [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> homeostasis in iron-overloaded thalassemic mice, with consistent improvement of cardiac contractility."

Here, we show that capsaicin-induced oxidative DNA damage culminates in p53 activation to up-regulate expression of miR-34a in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells. Functional analyses further indicate that restoration of miR-34a inhibits B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein expression to withdraw the survival advantage of these resistant NSCLC cells. In such a proapoptotic cellular milieu, where drug resistance proteins are also down-regulated, p53-transactivated Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial death cascade. Our results suggest that p53/miR-34a regulatory axis might be critical in sensitizing drug-resistant NSCLC cells."

Each treatment led to significant reductions of fasting triglycerides and cholesterol. Lowering of fasting and integrated diurnal triglycerides was greatest with bezafibrate. HDL-cholesterol profiles were highest with this drug. A strong correlation between fasting and diurnal triglycerides was observed.

This enzyme, which is essential for the survival of this bacterium, is involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. A computer-aided fragment-based protocol (ALTA) was first used to identify the aromatic fragments able to block the interface pocket that separates two neighboring enzyme subunits and is located at the active site entrance. Chemical modification of its non-aromatic moiety through an olefin cross-metathesis and Seebach's self-reproduction of chirality synthetic principle allowed the development of a quinazolinedione derivative that disables the catalytic loop plasticity, which is essential for the enzyme's catalytic cycle. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the ligand would force the catalytic loop into an inappropriate arrangement for catalysis by strong interactions with the catalytic tyrosine and by expelling the essential arginine out of the active site."

The overall results revealed the superior reinforcement efficiency of NBCs to Cloisite 30B clays and HNTs, owing to their typical porous structures to actively interact with PVA matrices in the combined formation of strong mechanical and hydrogen bondings. Three-dimensional NBCs also achieved better nanoparticle dispersibility when compared with 1D Cloisite 30B clays and 2D HNTs along with higher thermal stability, which was attributed to their larger interfacial regions when characterised for the nanomechanical behaviour of corresponding bionanocomposite films.

A new approach for fast and full extraction of the COM parameters for multielectrode-type grating is proposed. The field distribution of the wave under the periodic shorted grating is calculated by periodic Green's function method. The phase of the reflection is determined from the positions of the standing wave node. The transduction coefficient and its phase are determined by the charge distribution at low frequency. The COM parameters of the commonly used electrode width controlled (EWC) single phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT) is computed. It shows that this is a simple and direct way to extract all the COM parameters for SPUDT and, accordingly, is a powerful tool for the optimization of the filter structure."

No signs of general toxicity were found. There was a normal increase in weight, and normal food consumption, organ to body weight ratios and normal histological findings in liver, kidney and lung. Exposure to 500 p.p.m. (0.05 MAC) of halothane induced the activity of NADPH-cytochrome-c-reductase in the liver, decreased the concentration of cytochrome P-450 in the kidney and decreased all the enzyme concentrations measured in lung microsomes. Exposure to halothane 50 p.p.m. (0.005 MAC) and enflurane produced only minor changes. It is concluded that the inhalation of halothane, in contrast to enflurane, may affect drug metabolism and thereby drug kinetics and toxicity.

MycoIF was nondialyzable and unaffected by freezing, lyophilization, or incubation at 60 C for 30 min. However, MycoIF was inactivated after incubation at 80 C for 30 min. MycoIF was unaffected by low hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 7 to 12), but exposure to higher hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 6, pH 5) significantly decrease MycoIF activity, and exposure to pH 4 to 2 abolished all activity.

However, in transboundary watersheds, integrating cross-disciplinary and multinational datasets is a daunting task due to the disparity of data sources and the inconsistencies in data format, content, resolution, and language. This paper introduces a socio-environmental geodatabase that transcends political and disciplinary boundaries in the Rio Grande/R\u00edo Bravo basin (RGB). The geodatabase aggregates 145 GIS data layers on five main themes: (i) Water & Land Governance, (ii) Hydrology, (iii) Water Use & Hydraulic Infrastructures, (iv) Socio-Economics, and (v) Biophysical Environment. Datasets were primarily collected from public open-access data sources, processed with ArcGIS, and documented through the FGCD metadata standard. By synthesizing a broad array of datasets and mapping public and private water governance, we expect to advance interdisciplinary research in the RGB, provide a replicable approach to dataset compilation for transboundary watersheds, and ultimately foster transboundary collaboration for sustainable resource management."

The detection limits were 1 ppb for diuron and 10 ppb for simetryn, simazine, and atrazine. The simple and low-cost nature of sensing of the developed biosensor sensor chip has apparently created opportunities for regular water quality monitoring, where pesticides are an important concern."

Recent evidence suggests that the SNRPN gene, which is defective in PWS, plays a central role in the imprinting-center regulation of the PWS/AS region. To increase our understanding of the regulation of expression of this imprinted gene, we have developed single-cell-sensitive procedures for the analysis of expression of the SNRPN gene during early human development. Transcripts of SNRPN were detected in human oocytes and at all stages of preimplantation development analyzed. Using embryos heterozygous for a polymorphism within the SNRPN gene, we showed that monoallelic expression from the paternal allele occurs by the 4-cell stage. Thus, the imprinting epigenetic information inherited in the gametes is recognized already in the preimplantation embryo. The demonstration of monoallelic expression in embryos means that efficient preimplantation diagnosis of PWS may be made by analysis for the presence or absence of SNRPN mRNA."

A mass could be detected by chest roentgenograms in 13 patients and computed tomographic scans in 15 patients. No patient had distant metastases at first admission. Thirteen patients were treated by surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. Thirteen of the 17 patients died 1 to 87 months (mean, 14.2) after therapy for STS.

        "text": "The number of V1b vasopressin receptors (V1bR) in the anterior pituitary plays an important role during adaptation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to stress in rats. Regulation of V1bR expression involves transcriptional and translational mechanisms. One of the elements mediating transcriptional activation of the rat V1bR gene is a long stretch of GAGA repeats (GAGA box) in the promoter located near the transcription start point capable of binding a protein complex of 127 kDa present in pituitary nuclear extracts. There is a lack of correlation between changes in V1bR mRNA and the number of VP binding sites, suggesting that V1bR expression depends on the efficiency of V1b R mRNA translation into protein. Two mechanisms by which the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the rat V1bR mRNA can mediate either inhibition or activation of V1bR mRNA translation have been identified. First, upstream open reading frames (ORF) present in the 5'-UTR repress translation of the major ORF encoding the V1b receptor, and secondly, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activates V1bR translation. Stimulation of IRES activity through protein kinase C-mediated pathways results in V1bR mRNA translation increasing V1bR protein levels. The existence of multiple loci of regulation for the V1bR at transcriptional and translational levels provides a mechanism to facilitate plasticity of regulation of the number of pituitary vasopressin receptors according to physiological demand."

This study aimed at comparing the properties of plasma cell-free DNA with the biopsy's DNA in order to evaluate the clinical significance of IgH and TCR\u03b3 gene rearrangement in plasma cell-free DNA from patients with non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. A total of 360 samples were studied. IgH (FR3A/VLJH) and TCR\u03b3 (TVG/TJX) were amplified by PCR. Results of plasma cell-free DNA were compared with biopsy's DNA and mononuclear cellular DNA respectively. Plasma cell-free DNA were successfully extracted from 288 cases of newly diagnosed, refractory and relapsed NHL in total 360 patients (80%).But nothing was found in the other 72 remittent patients. The positive percentage of IgH rearrangement in patients with B-NHL was 81% in plasma cell-free DNA and 77% in biopsy's DNA (P>0.05). As to the ratio of TCR\u03b3 rearrangement in patients with T-NHL, the former was 44%, and the latter was 39% (P>0.05). These results show tumor-derived DNA could be detected in tumor loaded plasma, even of underlying cancer patients. For NHL patients, detecting IgH and TCR\u03b3 gene rearrangement of plasma cell-free DNA has the same clinical significance as biopsy's DNA. Moreover, it's more simple, convenient and non-invasive."

The aim of this study was to study the toxicity of different extractions, components and constituents of P. multiflorum, which were assessed in zebrafish embryos. Firstly, the difference of extracting solvent to the toxicity of P. multiflorum was researched to probe the influence of usages to the safety of P. multiflorum. The toxicity of 70% EtOH extract is considerably higher than that of other extracts. Secondly, 70% EtOH extract was subjected to macroporous resin (DM-8) eluting with a gradient of water and EtOH (H<sub>2</sub>O, 25% EtOH, 40% EtOH and 95% EtOH) to give four components (A-D). The toxicity of the component (D) showed higher than the other components (A-C). Thus, the component (D) was taken more attentions to research. Lastly, study on the chemical constituents of the component (D), 27 compounds, including 7 anthraquinones (1-7), 8 stilbenes (8-15), 7 anthrones (16-22), 3 cinnamic acid amides (23-25), 2 naphthols (26-27) were isolated and assessed in zebrafish embryos.

Given the safety profile and nonsteroidal mechanism of pimecrolimus, there has been significant interest in its use in the treatment of a variety of dermatological conditions. This article reviews research that has been published on the off-label uses of topical pimecrolimus, with a focus on published RCTs. Convincing evidence exists supporting pimecrolimus' efficacy in oral lichen planus and seborrheic dermatitis. For other conditions studied to date, pimecrolimus may prove to be a useful treatment alternative when conventional agents fail. Adverse events seen with its off-label use were typically application site reactions, the most common being a transient burning sensation. In summary, pimecrolimus appears to be an effective agent in the treatment of multiple dermatological conditions and may be worth considering as a pharmacologic alternative in several conditions when first-line treatment fails, or for areas that are more susceptible to the adverse effects of topical corticosteroids."

To elucidate the hydrophilic and hydrophobic effects of alcohols, their interactions with simple solute species are investigated in glassy, liquid, and crystalline water using temperature-programmed desorption and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Nonpolar solute species embedded underneath amorphous solid water films are released during crystallization, but they tend to withstand water crystallization under the coexistence of methanol additives. The CO<sub>2</sub> additives are released after crystallization along with methanol desorption. These results suggest strongly that nonpolar species that are hydrated (i.e., caged) associatively with methanol can withstand water crystallization. In contrast, ethanol and 1-propanol additives weakly affect the dehydration of nonpolar species during water crystallization, suggesting that the former tend to be caged separately from the latter. The hydrophilic vs. hydrophobic behavior of alcohols, which differs according to the aliphatic group length, also manifests itself in the different abilities of surface segregation of alcohols and their effects on the water crystallization kinetics."

The output of this nonlinearity is converted to driven discharge rate by the saturating nonlinearity originally used by Sachs and Abbas (1974). In fitting the model to data four model parameters are chosen to minimize the mean squared error between rate functions generated by the model and the data. With parameters chosen in this way, the model provides good fits to the range of rate-level shapes from flat saturations to sloping saturations. One important parameter in the model is the 'threshold for compression'. For low- and medium-spontaneous rate fibers with similar best frequencies (BFs), the minimum mean squared error compression threshold is roughly constant at about 30 dB above the thresholds of the most sensitive (high-spontaneous rate) fibers at that BF."

At the beginning of the 19th century, medicine tried to overcome the ancient contradiction within the unity of scientific thought and the deduction of guidelines and techniques for medical practice. This aim was partly achieved in medico-theoretical reasoning and practical procedures as well as for nosology, casuistic thinking and diagnostics. But medicine is a discipline directed towards healing. So the intentions of medicine and the reality of clinical healing possibilities, however, showed an increasing divergence since the middle of the 19th century. This divergence triggered considerable reactions not only from \"Schulmedizin\" and from other disciplines but also from practicing doctors and mainly from (disappointed) patients. Together with the continuous changes in empirical clinical research these internal and especially external reactions to medicine showed fundamental differences between medicine and the sciences. During the decades of this development it has become obvious that medicine will never become a pure science, not even an applied science. As medicine is concerned with patients who need to be considered as individual subjects, medical knowledge and medical practice consequently form a dialectic unity which is directed by the patient as a subject."

A phantom with several wall thicknesses of bone-like material was constructed to simulate various cortical widths. The CT density at each level of thickness was measured on a GE 9800 CT scanner and on the OsteoQuant, a special CT scanner optimized for the measurement of bone in the extremities. The minimum width required to attain the correct material density was determined for each scanner. Additionally, the material density and width of the cortex in the radius and/or femur were measured by CT in 761 healthy subjects, ages 4-84 years. The minimum thickness necessary for an accurate density evaluation of the walls of the phantom by CT was 2-2.5 mm; below these thresholds the values fell in a linear way relative to width. In humans, the material density of cortical bone in the appendicular skeleton was not influenced by height or weight, and the values were similar for all subjects, as long as the cortical width was above 2-2.5 mm. The cortical width increased with age up to 30 years and decreased from 50 years on. We conclude that the material density of cortical bone in the appendicular skeleton can be measured accurately by CT if the thickness of the cortex exceeds 2-2.5 mm."

This paper reports on the influence of two different methods of determining 36-month survival of implants used to support different dental prostheses."

        "text": "The physiological benefits of dietary flavonoids have been attributed to their antioxidant and signaling properties. Our previous study revealed that hesperetin exhibits neuroprotection in PC12 cells by diverse mechanisms. Biological activities of flavonoids might be determined by their chemical structures. Here, we further studied the effects of hesperetin and its structural counterparts, isorhamnetin and isosakuranetin, on kinases related to survival signaling as well as other cytoprotective actions. Pretreatment with flavonoids (0.8 or 50 microM) increased cell viability and catalase activity (CA) and decreased membrane damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, intracellular calcium level ([Ca2+]i), and caspase-3 activity in H2O2-treated PC12 cells. Increased CA, [Ca2+]i, and ROS levels, but lower caspase-3 activities, were obtained upon treatment with 50 microM isorhamnetin or isosakuranetin. Based on their structural differences and the concentrations used, these flavonoids differentially activated pro-survival signaling molecules, including Akt/protein kinase B, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and inhibited the activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase, which triggers apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that signaling actions of thses flavonoids are involved in their neuroprotection against oxidative stress and that they act more as signaling molecules than antioxidants."

Here, we examined the effect of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) and the agonist of the thyroid hormone receptor beta isoform (TRbeta), GC-1, on fatty liver and steatohepatitis induced in rodents by a choline-methionine deficient (CMD) diet. Male Fischer 344 rats fed a CMD diet for 1 wk developed a marked fatty liver and mild hepatitis. Concurrent administration of T3 resulted in a complete prevention of the fatty change associated with increased fatty acid mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation. To investigate whether T3 could also reverse fully established fatty liver, rats were fed a CMD diet for 10 wk and then cofed T3 for 1 wk. Coadministration of T3 resulted in a complete regression of liver steatosis associated with a decrease of lipid peroxidation, cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and activation of phospho-STAT3 and phospho-SAPK/JNK. Finally, additional experiments showed that GC-1, which has no significant side effects on heart rate, prevented and reverted CMD-induced fat accumulation, and ameliorated steatohepatitis. These results indicate that TR agonists have the potential to inhibit or reverse hepatic steatosis induced by a nutritional model."

The aim of this review was to evaluate the clinical benefits of using smart insulin pens with connectivity for diabetes management. The search was performed using PubMed and PubMed Central on May 15, 2019, to identify publications investigating the use of insulin pens. Studies evaluating insulin pens with connectivity via Bluetooth/Near Field Communication, with an associated electronic device enabling connectivity, or with a memory function were included in the review. Nine studies were identified in the search. Overall, these studies lacked data on smart insulin pens with a connectivity function, with eight of the available studies investigating only pens with a memory function. The studies focused primarily on assessing patient preference, usability, and technical accuracy. The number of studies assessing clinical outcomes was small (<i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;3). However, the majority of studies (<i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;8) reported that patients preferred smart insulin pens because they increased confidence with regard to diabetes self-management. These results suggest a lack of published data regarding smart insulin pens with connectivity for the management of diabetes. However, the available published data on usability and patient preference suggest that the use of smart insulin pens holds promise for improving and simplifying diabetes self-management."

The mean maximal systolic velocity was 6.92 \u00b1 1.78 cm/sec, the mean early diastolic velocity (Em) was 6.58 \u00b1 1.81 cm/sec, the mean late diastolic velocity (Am) was 5.10 \u00b1 2.00 cm/sec, the mean isovolumic contraction time (IVCT) was 53.61 \u00b1 95.13 msec, and the mean isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) was 26.74 \u00b1 57.24 msec. The early diastolic mitral inflow velocity (E)/Em ratio was 10.94 \u00b1 3.27 while the Em/Am ratio was 1.40 \u00b1 0.40. There was a negative correlation between Am duration and Am amplitude, and a positive correlation between the IVRT and Em/Am ratio (p < 0.05).

When telomeres are unmasked, genome instability arises. Balancing capping requirements with telomere replication and the enzymatic processing steps that are obligatory for telomere function is a complex problem. Telomeric proteins and their interacting factors create an environment at chromosome ends that inhibits DNA repair; however, the repair machinery is essential for proper telomere function."

To provide holistic nursing care to immigrant families, it is important to know the sources of family efficacy particularly for immigrant adolescents when they are developing health behavior. This integrative review examined existing literature to learn about the sources of family efficacy among immigrant adolescents and how different domain of family efficacy is related to risky behaviors.

Findings showed that multidimensional sources of family efficacies (specifically those in the relational, pragmatic, and value-laden domains) exert significant positive effects on immigrant adolescents' health behaviors."

Mutations in the <i>GAN</i> gene have been identified as the cause of this disorder. In this report, we performed a detailed phenotypic assessment of a Chinese patient with GAN. An array-based exon capture test and targeted next-generation sequencing were used to detect the suspected mutation sites. Compound heterozygous mutations of p.S79L (c.236C &gt; T) in the BTB domain and p.T489S (c.1466C &gt; G) in the kelch domain were identified in the proband's genome. S79L was a known mutation, and T489S was reported for the first time. The p.S79L and p.T489S were confirmed in the proband's mother and father, respectively. Both mutations were located in highly conserved regions and affected the predicted protein crystal structures. The proband's sural biopsy revealed the classical GAN phenotype of swollen axons filled with closely packed neurofilaments. The combined application of the next-generation sequencing platform and bioinformatics analyses was an effective method for diagnosing GAN. The novel compound mutations of S79L and T489S in the <i>GAN</i> gene were likely the cause of the patient's GAN symptoms. Our findings enrich the spectrum of mutations associated with this rare type of axonopathy."

The chain of successively acting enzymes and mediators constitutes, obviously, a cascade amplifying the estradiol action. Since histamine is known to act as an intercellular mediator, attempts were made to find out the distribution of estradiol, histamine, and cyclic 3',5'-AMP among uterine cells. Autoradiography has shown that 3H-estradiol is bound by the nuclei of myometrium cells, 3H-histamine was found in the cytoplasm of these cells, 3H-cyclic 3',5'-AMP is selectively bound by the cells of capillary endothelium of the uterus.

Oxidation and reduction potentials were measured and excited state redox properties were calculated from this data. Turnover numbers, initial rates, and induction periods for oxygen production in the presence of a blue LED light and sodium persulfate as a sacrificial oxidant were measured. Similar experiments were run without irradiation. Dyad performance correlated well with the difference between the excited state reduction potential of the photosensitizer and the ground state oxidation potential of the water oxidation dyad.

The baroreceptors of the carotid sinus and aortic arch were activated by raising the blood pressure with an intravenous injection of phenylephrine. Chemoreceptor stimulation activated and baroreceptor stimulation inhibited the discharge of all the phasically discharging neurones tested. Neither stimulus had any consistent effect on non-phasically discharging neurones, although slight inhibition occasionally occurred. Anaesthesia of the carotid bifurcation abolished the effects of cardiovascular stimulation on the supraoptic neurones. Responses resumed when the anaesthesia wore off. However, the anaesthesia also seemed to alter the phasic pattern of discharge. The results are discussed with reference to the influence of the cardiovascular receptors upon the neurones in the supraoptic nucleus, and with reference to possible roles for the cardiovascular reflexes in control of vasopressin secretion."

Vein grafts are more durable in the renal artery bed than in coronary and peripheral beds, and mechanisms of potential graft failure vary. Coronary vein grafts often fail because of atherosclerotic degeneration, whereas lower extremity grafts fail because of intimal hyperplasia or progression of underlying disease. In contrast, renal vein grafts may dilate over time but seldom fail. This may relate to the distinct hemodynamic environment of the renal bed with low-resistance, high-velocity blood flow. However, frank aneurysmal degeneration of renal vein grafts is rare with only a single report of rupture in the literature. We report an additional case of rupture of a late graft aneurysm and review the literature and our own experience with renal revascularization to underscore the rarity of this serious complication. The saphenous vein for aortorenal bypass grafting continues to be a favorable conduit for renal revascularization. Long-term duplex ultrasound scanning follow-up is recommended to survey the reconstructed artery and perhaps more important, to evaluate progression of subclinical disease in the contralateral renal artery."

We noticed that endothelial cells produce more than twice the amount of prostacyclin when incubated with thrombin and arachidonic acid together than with arachidonic acid alone. In addition, it was found that the thrombin-induced conversion of endogenous substrates was inhibited by exogenous arachidonic acid. This means that the conversion of exogenous added arachidonic acid to prostacyclin was stimulated by thrombin. This activation of the enzymes involved in prostacyclin synthesis lasted about 5 min and could be inhibited by phospholipase inhibitors such as mepacrine and p-bromophenyl-acylbromide but not by the cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP, an inhibitor of arachidonic acid release from cellular phospholipids.

One possibility for achieving this is by influencing the solidification which then directly affects the local part properties. In this study, the effect of different laser beam profiles with gaussian and top-hat intensity distributions, as well as the influence of varying parameter sets on the microstructure and microhardness within the same specimen, was examined. A test specimen consisting of many small cubes was built with different parameters. It was found that the local properties can be varied in a wide range. Build-height-dependent in-situ aging effects can thereby be exploited for tailoring the local material properties.

We examine the validity of this assumption by constructing extended substitution matrices that encapsulate the observed correlations between neighboring sites, by developing an efficient and rigorous algorithm for pairwise protein sequence alignment that incorporates these local substitution correlations and by assessing the ability of this algorithm to detect remote homologies."

There are few studies on the intestinal virome, and whether it has a causal relationship with bacterial changes in the gut is still unclear. However, it is undeniable that the intestinal virome is also a very important portion of the blueprint for the development of liver diseases and the diagnosis and therapeutic modalities in the future."

This paper describes the results of further investigations provoked by interest in these early changes. Increases in the numbers of immunoglobulin-secreting cells were observed in syngeneically, but scarcely or not at all in allogeneically, mated mice. Increases were not observed in surgically sterilized female mice inseminated by normal males. However, subcutaneous injection of sperm provoked massive increases in the numbers of immunoglobulin-secreting cells in the lymph nodes draining the injection site. The changes were compared with those provoked by the injection of spleen cells and LPS. The results are discussed in relation to the nature of the interactions provoking the increases in the number of immunoglobulin-secreting cells and their possible relationship to immunosuppression, and the relative immunological unresponsiveness which the female shows to the challenge of inseminated sperm."

First, routine operating data is used for system identification in closed loop; second, a one-class support vector machine (SVM) is trained to predict MPM. The iterative identification method alternates between identifying the finite impulse response coefficients of the spatial and temporal models. It converges, and the parameter estimates are asymptotically consistent. Coefficient estimates drawn from normal operation are used to train a one-class SVM, which then detects model-plant mismatch in subsequent routine operation. This approach applies to routine operating data without requiring external excitations. It can also distinguish mismatches in the process model from changes in the noise model. Examples of CD processes on paper machines are provided to verify the effectiveness of both components."

Visual dysfunction in PD may involve visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, color discrimination, pupil reactivity, saccadic and pursuit eye movements, motion perception, visual fields, and visual processing speeds. In addition, disturbance of visuospatial orientation, facial recognition problems, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, and chronic visual hallucinations may be present. Problems affecting pupil reactivity, stereopsis, pursuit eye movement, and visuomotor adaptation, when accompanied by REM sleep behavior disorder, could be early features of PD. Dementia associated with PD is associated with enhanced eye movement problems, visuospatial deficits, and visual hallucinations. Visual dysfunction may be a useful diagnostic feature in differentiating PD from other parkinsonian symptoms, visual hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and variation in saccadic eye movement problems being particularly useful discriminating features."

However, a LMS adaptive filter with a fixed step size always suffers from slow convergence rate or large signal distortion due to the diversity of the application environments. An ideal adaptive filtering system should be able to adapt different environments and obtain the useful signals with low distortion. Adaptive filter with gradient adaptive step size is therefore more desirable in order to meet the demands of adaptation and convergence rate, which adjusts the step-size parameter automatically by using gradient descent technique. In this paper, a novel gradient adaptive step size LMS adaptive filter is presented. The proposed algorithm utilizes two adaptive filters to estimate gradients accurately, thus achieves good adaptation and performance. Though it uses two LMS adaptive filters, it has a low computational complexity. An active noise cancellation (ANC) system with two applications for extracting heartbeat and lung sound signals from noises is used to simulate the performance of the proposed algorithm."

Furthermore, we identified a cluster of charged residues KIKEE in the C-terminus of MJ0170 that strikingly resembled the charged C-terminal amino acid cluster present in Eco-MscL (RKKEE). We cloned and expressed MJ0170 in E. coli, which when reconstituted into liposomes or expressed in the cell membrane of giant E. coli spheroplasts, exhibited similar activity to the bacterial MS channels.

Drosophila melanogaster female meiosis is unusual in that it is both exceptionally tolerant of nonexchange chromosomes and competent in ensuring their proper segregation. As first noted by Puro and Nokkala [Puro, J., Nokkala, S., 1977. Meiotic segregation of chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster oocytes. A cytological approach. Chromosoma 63, 273-286], nonexchange chromosomes move precociously towards the poles following formation of a bipolar spindle. Indeed, metaphase arrest has been previously defined as the stage at which nonexchange homologs are symmetrically positioned between the main chromosome mass and the poles of the spindle. Here we use studies of both fixed images and living oocytes to show that the stage in which achiasmate chromosomes are separated from the main mass does not in fact define metaphase arrest, but rather is a component of an extended prometaphase. At the end of prometaphase, the nonexchange chromosomes retract into the main chromosome mass, which is tightly repackaged with properly co-oriented centromeres. This repackaged state is the true metaphase arrest configuration in Drosophila female meiosis."

Evolving research thrusts involve interfacing traditional and molecular systematics/diagnostics, adoption of the Caenorhabditis elegans-molecular genetics resource for general nematological research, focus on genetics of parasitism, use of molecular tools in developing host resistance, ecological and quantitative facets, and soil-biology-ecology based integrated management.

It is frequently accompanied by constitutional symptoms and by anemia or other cytopenias, which make treatment difficult, as the latter are often worsened by most current therapies. Cytoreductive treatment, usually hydroxyurea, is the first-line therapy, being effective in around 40% of the patients, although the effect is often short lived. The immunomodulatory drugs, such as thalidomide or lenalidomide, rarely show a substantial activity in reducing the splenomegaly. Splenectomy can be considered in patients refractory to drug treatment, but the procedure involves substantial morbidity as well as a certain mortality risk and, therefore, patient selection is important. For patients not eligible for splenectomy, transient relief of the symptoms can be obtained with local radiotherapy that, in turn, can induce severe and long-lasting cytopenias. Allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only treatment with the potential for curing MF but, due to its associated morbidity and mortality, is usually restricted to a minority of patients with poor risk features. A new class of drugs, the JAK2 inhibitors, although also palliative, are promising in the splenomegaly of MF and will probably change the therapeutic algorithm of this disease."

Although 36-48% of RP patients are isolated cases, the remainder show autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked modes of inheritance. The X-linked variety ( XLRP ) is found in 14-22% of RP families in the UK. In the present study, X chromosome-specific recombinant DNA probes which can detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms have been used to localize the XLRP gene(s) to a subregion of the X chromosome using linkage analysis. One of the probes, L1.28, has been shown to be closely linked to XLRP in five kindreds, with 95% confidence limits of 0-15 centimorgans (maximum LOD score of 7.89 at a distance of 3 centimorgans). This suggests that the XLRP locus lies on the proximal part of the short arm of the X chromosome.

While most post-AKI patients recover their baseline renal function, a significant number, approximately ~20% of those affected, will go on to develop long term illness characterized by an increase in late stage CKD, cardiovascular complications, and increased death rates. When AKI occurs in hospitalized patients, selected demographic and laboratory results can be incorporated into risk calculators that identify those at higher risk for long-term complications. This review touches on some of the salient epidemiological studies of the AKI to CKD transition. It also focuses on certain recent advancements in our understanding of the biological and functional impact of AKI on the renal tubule repair mechanism, as well as the important role that genetic, epigenetic, biochemical and inflammatory events, seemingly beneficial to the re-establishment of normal renal function, can be offset by mediators of progressive fibrosis and irreversible structural changes. Characterization of basic processes that mediate the AKI to CKD transition reveals promising pharmacological and biological agents that hopefully will one day be used in the early stages of AKI to prevent its deadly consequences."

Three experienced ultrasonographers used a subjective scale to rate the oligohydramnios as mild, moderate, severe, or anhydramniotic. Interobserver reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.81). The overall perinatal mortality rate was 43%, and the incidence of pulmonary hypoplasia was 33%. One-third had lethal congenital anomalies. The frequency of adverse outcome correlated strongly with the most severe degrees of oligohydramnios; 88% of the fetuses with severe oligohydramnios or anhydramnios had lethal outcomes, compared with 11% in the mild/moderate group. The presence of an anuric urinary tract anomaly was associated with the most severe grades of oligohydramnios and was uniformly fatal. Pulmonary hypoplasia was diagnosed in 60% of the severe group versus 6% in the moderate group. We conclude that subjective grading of oligohydramnios by experienced observers is both reliable and predictive of outcome. The finding of severe oligohydramnios in the second trimester is highly predictive of poor fetal outcome and should stimulate a thorough search for etiology and consideration of intervention. Moderate grades of reduced amniotic fluid may be managed with relative optimism."

        "text": "Integrating conjugative elements (ICEs) of the SXT/R391 family are major contributors to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. These elements also catalyze their own diversity by promoting inter-ICE recombination through the action of the RecA-independent homologous recombination system that they encode. Here, we report that expression of this recombination system, which consists of the single-stranded DNA annealing protein Bet and the exonuclease Exo, is induced by DNA-damaging agents via ICE-encoded transcriptional regulators. We show that the bet and exo genes are part of a large polycistronic transcript that contains many conserved ICE genes that are not involved in the main integration/excision and conjugative transfer processes. We show that although the recombination genes are highly transcribed, their translation is subject to additional strong regulatory mechanisms. We also show that an ICE-encoded putative single-stranded DNA binding protein (Ssb) limits hybrid ICE formation. Finally, a thorough in silico analysis reveals that orthologues of Bet and Exo are widely distributed in bacterial strains belonging to very distantly related bacterial species and are carried by various mobile genetic elements. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the annealing proteins and exonucleases that compose these systems sometimes have different evolutionary origins, underscoring the strong selective pressure to maintain the functionality of these unrelated cooperating proteins."

In the research on methylammonium lead-iodide (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>), a lot of work has been devoted to optimize the film morphology and crystallinity resulting in an enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE). A good surface coverage and uniform perovskite films are highly desirable along with a smooth and pinhole-free contact between the hole and electron extraction layers. Overall, this affects the charge transport and collection, and reduces charge recombination. Herein, we demonstrate a facile route to control perovskite crystallization by inserting an optimal amount of insulating polystyrene in the perovskite precursor solutions. The incorporation of a small amount of polystyrene results in much better surface coverage, and a smoother and uniform perovskite thin film leading to improved crystallization and larger grain size. <i>Via</i> careful optimization, and easy and low temperature solution-based processing, below 100 &#176;C, we realize a device with PCE exceeding 13% along with significantly reduced leakage current."

The implications of these findings with respect to the amorphous semiconductor model proposed to describe the dynamic role of epidermal melanin are discussed. From the experimental data, values of physical parameters were calculated which allow a qualitative correlation between chemical states and electronic behaviour and, consequently, some aspects of the molecular biology of the melanosome, founded on a rigorous base."

Here, we characterize the magnetic SPLITT system using magnetically susceptible particles and ion-labeled particles. The flow axis of separation channel was orientated parallel and perpendicular to gravitational forces to exclude and include, respectively, gravitational effects on separation. Both operating modes were used to test the theory experimentally, with emphasis on the parallel mode. The magnetic susceptibilities of carrier and ion-labeled particles were varied, and various ion-labeled and unlabeled particles were studied experimentally, resulting in successful separation of labeled particles, yeasts, and cells from unlabeled ones. The minimal difference in magnetic susceptibility (delta(chi)) required for complete particle separation was about 1.75 x 10(-5) [cgs], corresponding to about 10(9) labeling ions per particle in this study. The throughput was around 7.2 x 10(8) particles/h using the present setup. Magnetic SPLITT fractionation shows good potential for use in obtaining particles magnetic susceptibilities from a simple theoretical treatment."

In process I, under the optimized conditions of 10 wt % trioctylamine/octanol, the extraction efficiency and distribution coefficient of lactic acid were 50.8% and 1.03, respectively. In process II, a salting-out extraction step was introduced, which had significant impacts on the following reactive extraction process. The extraction efficiency and distribution coefficient of lactic acid were about 32.2% and 3.85 times higher than that of process I, respectively. All residual sugars and most of the salts (82.8%) could be removed by the salting-out extraction system used. Additionally, five extraction cycles with back-extraction and solvent regeneration were performed, and the results showed that the extraction system still exhibited stable performance. Effective extraction of lactic acid from crude reaction liquor of corn stover was realized by first salting-out and consecutive reactive extraction, which provided a potential method for recovery of lactic acid from actual biomass-derived liquor."

Here, we use machine-learning to determine how aspects of WM are dynamically coded in the human brain. Using cross-validation across independent fMRI studies, we demonstrate that stimulus domains (spatial, number and fractal) and WM processes (encode, maintain, probe) are classifiable with high accuracy from the patterns of network activity and connectivity that they evoke. This is the case even when focusing on 'multiple demands' brain regions, which are active across all WM conditions. Contrary to early neuropsychological perspectives, these aspects of WM do not map exclusively to brain areas or processing streams; however, the mappings from that literature form salient features within the corresponding multivariate connectivity patterns. Furthermore, connectivity patterns provide the most precise basis for classification and become fine-tuned as maintenance load increases. These results accord with a network-coding mechanism, where the same brain regions support diverse WM demands by adopting different connectivity states."

Clinical results and mechanisms of action are discussed in this review, including the molecular and biological rationale of hyperthermia as radio- and chemosensitizer as established in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Proven mechanisms include inhibition of different DNA repair processes, (in)direct reduction of the hypoxic tumour cell fraction, enhanced drug uptake, increased perfusion and oxygen levels. All mechanisms show different dose effect relationships and different optimal scheduling with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Therefore, obtaining the ideal multi-modality treatment still requires elucidation of more detailed data on dose, sequence, duration, and possible synergisms between modalities. A multidisciplinary approach with different modalities including hyperthermia might further increase anti-tumour effects and diminish normal tissue damage."

However, the distribution of inclusions of coated soot particles showed a mode in the range of 0.1-0.3 \u03bcm. The coating degree of coated soot particles, which was defined by the ratio of the diameter of inclusion to the diameter of particle body, showed a mode around 0.5 with the range of 0.3-0.6. These results indicate that the status of soot particles in the prefrontal and postfrontal air was similar although air pollution levels were dramatically different.

In situ hybridisation studies demonstrated high levels of Nav1.2, Nav1.3, Nav1.6 and beta3 mRNA at embryonic stages whilst Nabeta1.1 and Nabeta2.1 mRNA was absent throughout this period. 3. Nabeta1.1 and Nabeta2.1 expression occurred after postnatal day 3 (P3), increasing steadily in most brain regions until adulthood. beta3 expression differentially decreased after P3 in certain areas but remained high in the hippocampus and striatum. 4. Emulsion-dipped slides showed co-localisation of beta3 with Nav1.3 mRNA in areas of the CNS suggesting that these subunits may be capable of functional interaction. 5. Co-expression in Xenopus oocytes revealed that beta3 could modify the properties of Nav1.3; beta3 changed the equilibrium of Nav1.3 between the fast and slow gating modes and caused a negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation. 6. In conclusion, beta3 is shown to be the predominant beta subunit expressed during development and is capable of modulating the kinetic properties of the embryonic Nav1.3 subunit. These findings provide new information regarding the nature and properties of voltage-gated sodium channels during development."

The frequency with which they issued inadequate instructions, attempted to repair the inadequacies, and the success of repairs were compared. We observed that schizophrenics, on the whole, issued more wrong and incomplete instructions. This was in part related to their worse working memory, but it was not affected by verbal hallucinations or negative symptoms. We observed, further, that schizophrenics had no particular problems monitoring messages for inadequacies. We did find, however, that schizophrenics with verbal hallucinations had a specific problem with self-repairing wrong instructions. We interpret these results in the framework of Hoffman's (1986b) plan disruption-based model of verbal hallucinations; the Frith (1987) and Frith and Done (1988) internal monitoring model of positive and negative symptoms; and finally Frith and Frith's (1990) model of negative and positive schizophrenia and we use the results to specify the models."

One unique aspect of our language rests upon its appraisal of different grammatical tenses, such as the present progressive tense and the perfect one. Both the tenses are indexical in pointing to some movements in progress or registered in stasis as such out there as admitting no anthropocentric interventions. In particular, the material movement mediated by the transfer of the quantum particles is punctuated by the event of the transfer completed so far that can be referred to in the present perfect tense. At the same time, the transfer of the quantum particles can constantly induce the similar transfer in sequence in the following present progressive tense. Constant update of the present perfect tense in the subsequent progressive tense is agential in keeping no inconsistency between the two left behind in the finished record. That is the inconsistency-mediating cohesion acting between the present perfect and the progressive tenses. A most conspicuous case demonstrating the competency of inconsistency-mediating cohesion may be the origins of life. Molecular recognition widely observed in the biological realm is a specific instance of demonstrating such a molecular cohesion."

        "text": "Vasculitis can be defined as vascular inflammation which is usually immune mediated, leading to structural and functional damage to the vessel wall. Our concept of vasculitis has been built around the events surrounding immune-complex-triggered leukocytoclastic vasculitis, while the role of lymphocyte mediated vasculitis remains largely undefined. This may be due to maintaining a stereotypic image of lymphocytic vasculitis as one associated with vascular necrosis, fibrin deposition and haemorrhage and merely substituting lymphocytes for neutrophils. Our understanding of lymphocytic vasculitis may be advanced by identifying the clinical settings in which such reactions may occur, such as autoimmune skin diseases sharing features with graft vs host disease, as well as recognizing that lymphocyte mediated inflammation may lead to a morphologically distinct group of vasculitides, apart from those associated with angiodestruction. Lymphocytic endovasculitis, lymphocytic lichenoid vasculitis and granulomatous vasculitis are potential examples of lymphocytic vasculitis that differ from the histological pattern seen in association with immune complex leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Ultimately, the proof that these vasculitides are examples of lymphocytic vasculitis will rest on new techniques emerging in molecular pathology that have the capacity of analysing the immunological events beyond the current limitations posed by routine histopathology."

Here we investigate how many species of multicellular animals have been barcoded. We compare the numbers in a public database (GenBank as of January 2012) with those in the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) and find that GenBank contains COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1) sequences for ca. 60\u2003000 species while BOLD reports barcodes for ca. 150\u2003000 species. The discrepancy is likely due to a large amount of unpublished data in BOLD. Overall, the species coverage remains sparse, growth rates are low, and the barcode accumulation curve for Metazoa is linear with only 4788 species having been added in 2011. In addition, the vast majority of species in the public database (73%) were barcoded by projects that are unlikely to be related to the DNA barcoding movement. Particularly surprising was the large number of DNA barcodes in GenBank that were not identified to species (Jan 2012: 74%), with insect barcodes often being identified only to order. Of these several hundred thousand have since been suppressed by NCBI because they did not satisfy the iBOL/GenBank early release agreement. Species coverage is considerably better for target taxa of DNA barcoding campaigns (e.g. birds, fishes, Lepidoptera), although it also falls short of published campaign targets. \u00a9 The Willi Hennig Society 2012."

Women with an HPV-related diagnosis or intervention within the past 3 months were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey before the receipt of HPV-related diagnostic results. Participants completed a 29-item HPV impact profile (HIP), which was a questionnaire designed to represent the full spectrum of potential HPV-related impacts. The HIP assesses worries and concerns; emotional impact; sexual impact; self-image; partner issues and transmission; interactions with doctors; and control/life impact. The final sample size was 249 women from three hospitals. The mean HIP score (0-100) was normal Pap: 28.2; abnormal Pap: 44.3; CIN: 47.5; genital warts: 62.5; abnormal Pap with high-risk HPV positive: 48.8. This study indicates that significant psychological impact is found in women diagnosed with abnormal Pap, CIN, high-risk HPV test positive and genital wart compared to women with a normal Pap. Women with genital warts had the highest psychological impact scores. This is the first quantitative data that can lay the ground work for future studies that enable the comparison of the effectiveness of different interventions in alleviating the psychological burden of HPV-associated infection and preventive interventions in Taiwan."

The use of SWVC presents the advantage of giving rise to a peak-shaped response, which evolves to a charge plateau at high square wave pulse amplitudes, from which the total surface excess and the formal potential can be immediately measured for quasi-reversible and reversible processes. This characteristic represents its main advantage versus other multipotential step techniques, which lead to a negligible current under reversible conditions. The formal potential of the electroactive systems can be measured from the peak potential of the SWVC curves, even for quasi-reversible behavior. Moreover, the non-faradic effects on the response can be easily evaluated and avoided as is demonstrated in this paper. Experimental verification of the theoretical predictions is given for reversible and quasi-reversible systems."

Then, three clustering regions were clearly identified. Meanwhile, GCM was obviously associated with topography (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.11, p\u00a0<\u00a00.10), farmland (r\u00a0=\u00a00.11, p\u00a0<\u00a00.10), population density (r\u00a0=\u00a00.10, p\u00a0<\u00a00.10) and river density (r\u00a0=\u00a00.11, p\u00a0<\u00a00.10) in the buffered zones. It indicates that spatial grid technique is suitable for characterising GCM in Shenqiu County, and that GCM was geographically associated with environmental conditions.

In the mesothelium, a similar response is induced by high aspect ratio nanomaterials, including asbestos fibers, following intraperitoneal injection. This asbestos-like behaviour of some engineered nanomaterials is a concern for their potential adverse health effects in the lungs and mesothelium.

To elucidate the function of the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of the nanos2 gene in mice, we compared the phenotypes of lacZ knock-in mice with or without a native nanos2 3'UTR and found that this region of the nanos2 gene has a potential role during translational regulation in germ cells. The nanos2-3'UTR functions to repress the translation of mRNA in oocytes, but enhances the production of protein in the male gonads. To further understand the significance of the nanos2 3'UTR in vivo, we generated the mouse line nanos2pA/pA, which lacks this region endogenously. In nanos2(-/pA) mice, the number of germ cell-depleted seminiferous tubules was increased when compared with that of nanos2pA/pA mice, indicating a dose-dependent defect in spermatogenesis. These results suggest that the level of nanos2 protein is critical for normal spermatogenesis, and that this pathway may be regulated through the nanos2-3'UTR. We found that the defects in nanos2pA/pA and nanos2(-/pA) mice were caused by apoptosis of gonocytes in the embryonic gonads and gonocyte/spermatogonia in neonatal testes. In addition, it was noted that the nanos2 expression was restricted to a particular subset of spermatogonia after birth, which indicates that nanos2 plays a role in the maintenance and differentiation of gonocytes/spermatogonia in neonatal testes."

First, cells were treated with a synthetically biotinylated 13-HPODE (13-HPODE-biotin). Modified proteins were enriched by neutravidin affinity and identified by two-dimensional liquid chromatography--tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS). Second, cells were treated with native 13-HPODE. Protein carbonyls were biotinylated with an aldehyde reactive probe, and modified proteins were enriched by neutravidin affinity and identified by 2D LC-MS/MS. Third, using a newly developed DODE antibody, DODE-modified proteins were located by 2D sodium dodecyl sulfate--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot and identified by in-gel digestion and LC-MS/MS. Analysis of the proteins characterized by all three methods revealed a significant overlap and identified 32 primary proteins modified by DODE in MCF7 cells.

The burden of leishmaniasis is highest in children who may present with cutaneous or visceral manifestations. We describe systematically the manifestations, diagnosis and management of leishmaniasis in children <14 years of age, who had a histopathological diagnosis of leishmaniasis in Malta, from 2004 to 2008. Eleven children were diagnosed with leishmaniasis; 8 children (15-44 months of age) had visceral disease and three (aged 9-13 years) suffered cutaneous infections. Prolonged high grade fever, pallor, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia were common presenting features of visceralisation. Diagnosis was based on the visualisation of amastigotes from bone marrow aspirates. Pentavalent antimonials were associated with treatment failure in two children, whilst liposomal amphotericin B was curative in all. Children with cutaneous leishmaniasis had dry crusted ulcero-nodular lesions on exposed areas which responded to intra-lesional instillation of sodium stibogluconate or to cryotherapy. Leishmaniasis should be included in the differential diagnosis of fever and hepatosplenomegaly or chronic cutaneous lesions in children who travel to Malta."

Methylglyoxal (MG) is a major glycating agent that reacts with basic residues present in proteins and promotes the formation of AGEs. Sciadopitysin, a type of biflavonoid, exerts protective effects against neuronal cell damage; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of sciadopitysin against MG-mediated cytotoxicity in SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells. Our results demonstrated that pretreatment of SK-N-MC cells with sciadopitysin improved the cell viability that was inhibited by MG and inhibited the apoptosis induced by MG. Sciadopitysin attenuated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> , NOX4 levels, oxidative stress, and MG-protein adduct levels, and increased nuclear Nrf2 and glyoxalase 1 levels in the presence of MG. These results suggest that sciadopitysin exerts neuroprotective effects against MG-induced death of human SK-N-MC cells via its antioxidative action. This study highlights sciadopitysin as a promising candidate for antioxidant therapy and designing natural drugs against AGE-induced neurodegenerative disorders."

The complete amino acid sequence of beta-factor XIIa was then determined on peptides produced by enzymatic digestion with either trypsin, chymotrypsin, or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and by chemical cleavage at methionyl and tryptophyl bonds. beta-Factor XIIa is a glycoprotein composed of a heavy chain (243 amino acid residues) and a light chain (9 amino acid residues), and these two chains are held together by a disulfide bond. The carbohydrate is attached to asparagine residue 61 in the heavy chain. The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain shows a high degree of homology to the corresponding regions of other plasma serine proteases, such as plasmin, thrombin, factor IXa and factor Xa, as well as the pancreatic digestive enzymes. These results demonstrate that factor XII is the precursor of a typical serine protease that participates in the coagulation cascade."

Casticin is a phytochemical from Vitex species such as Vitex rotundifolia and Vitex agnus-castus that was recently shown to exert an anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. To demonstrate the effects of casticin, C57BL/6 mice were whole-body exposed to mainstream CS or fresh air for two weeks and treated with 1, 2, and 10mg/kg casticin via an i.p. injection. Immune cell infiltrations and cytokine productions were assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage Fluid (BALF), and lung histological analysis was performed. Treatment with casticin was observed to significantly inhibit the numbers of total cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes and reduce the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the BALF. In addition, casticin significantly decreased the infiltration of peribronchial and perivascular inflammatory cells and the epithelium thickness. The results of this study indicate that casticin has significant effects on the lung inflammation induced by CS in a mouse model. According to these outcomes, casticin may have therapeutic potential in inflammatory lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."

The prevalence of aneurysms in the normal population is 2\u200a-\u200a3\u200a%. It increases to 4\u200a-\u200a10\u200a% in persons with one relative with an aneurysm and to about 20\u200a% in persons with two relatives with an aneurysm. The average natural rupture risk is estimated to be 5\u200a% within 5 years of detection. In the individual case it depends on several variables that are discussed here. According to the literature, the risk of endovascular aneurysm treatment is about 5\u200a%. On the basis of these data, the benefit of MRA screening needs to be discussed individually with the patient."

Published phase II and phase III studies as well as their personal experiences were evaluated by the authors to develop this consensus statement. The largest published experience with multiple-day chemotherapy is with 5-day cisplatin combination chemotherapy. The introduction of 5-HT3 antagonists greatly improved emetic control. However, day 4-5 nausea as well as delayed nausea and vomiting remains a clinical problem despite the inclusion of dexamethasone. A 5-HT3 antagonist plus dexamethasone is the preferred current option for patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant. However, the results do not appear as successful as for highly emetic standard-dose chemotherapy."

Due to the complexity of this population and the toxicity of HDCT, we evaluated the association between blood-based systemic inflammatory indexes and the outcome of GCT patients undergoing salvage treatment with HDCT in order to define additional prognostic factors able to orient clinical decision. Baseline characteristics, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) of 62 patients undergoing HDCT for GCT were retrospectively collected. The aim is to evaluate the correlation between each inflammatory marker (NLR, PLR, and SII) and response to HDCT, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Using the receiver operating curve to identify the best cutoff values, it was found that patients with GCT with NLR \u22653.3 and SII \u2265844,000 had shorter PFS and inferior OS. In the multivariable analysis including inflammatory markers, the International Prognostic Factor Study Group (IPFSG) risk group, age, and previous line of treatment, NLR \u22653.3 and SII \u2265844,000 were identified to be independently associated with shorter PFS and OS. Moreover, NLR, PLR, and SII significantly correlate with overall response to HDCT. Associating IPFSG prognostic score to inflammatory markers at baseline of HDCT may improve prognostic information and could help physicians to make more personalized treatment decisions."

Once the shaking is over, the excess pore water pressures that developed during the earthquake gradually dissipate, while the surface of the soil settles, in a process called post-liquefaction reconsolidation. When examining reconsolidation, the soil is typically divided in liquefied and solidified parts, which are modelled separately. The aim of this paper is to show that this fragmentation is not necessary. By assuming that the hydraulic conductivity and the one-dimensional stiffness of liquefied sand have real, positive values, the equation of consolidation can be numerically solved throughout a reconsolidating layer. Predictions made in this manner show good agreement with geotechnical centrifuge experiments. It is shown that the variation of one-dimensional stiffness with effective stress and void ratio is the most crucial parameter in accurately capturing reconsolidation."

In some cases, the arms race ensued at the establishment of a symbiotic relationship results in the adoption of manipulative strategies by the parasite. We have already learned that Steinina ctenocephali, a gregarine living in the alimentary canal of cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis follows its phenology and metamorphosis. Despite these findings the outcome of their symbiotic partnership (mutualist, parasitic or commensal) remains unclear. To address this important question, we measured life history parameters of the flea in the presence of varying infection intensities of gregarine oocysts in laboratory conditions. We found that neither the emergence nor survival rate of fleas was affected by harbouring the gregarines. More surprisingly, our results show that flea larvae infected with gregarines developed faster and emerged earlier than the control group. This gregarine therefore joins the selected group of protists that can modify physiological host traits and provides not only new model taxa to be explored in an evolutionary scenario, but also potential development of control strategies of cat flea."

L-WNK1 is an ubiquitously expressed kinase that is activated in response to osmotic stress and intracellular chloride depletion, and it is implicated in two distinct hereditary syndromes: the renal disease pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII) and the neurological disease hereditary sensory neuropathy 2 (HSN2). The effect of L-WNK1 on KCC activity is unknown. Using Xenopus laevis oocytes and HEK-293 cells, we show that the activation of KCCs by cell swelling was prevented by L-WNK1 coexpression. In contrast, the activity of the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter NKCC1 was remarkably increased with L-WNK1 coexpression. The negative effect of L-WNK1 on the KCCs is kinase dependent. Elimination of the STE20 proline-alanine rich kinase (SPAK)/oxidative stress-responsive kinase (OSR1) binding site or the HQ motif required for the WNK-WNK interaction prevented the effect of L-WNK1 on KCCs, suggesting a required interaction between L-WNK1 molecules and SPAK. Together, our data support that NKCC1 and KCCs are coordinately regulated by L-WNK1 isoforms."

However, it appears that the major causes of immediate post-operative paraplegia are the depth and duration of ischemia during the period of aortic cross-clamping and failure to identify and reimplant critical vessels that supply blood to the spinal cord. Delayed paraplegia, which has been reported to occur from 1 to 21 days after surgery, is most commonly caused by postoperative hypotension. We believe that the final approach to the prevention of paraplegia following procedures on the thoracic aorta will be one that involves the use of a technique to assure oxygenation of the spinal cord during aortic cross-clamping, through an alternate vascular tree, along with a method that can uniformly depict critical vessels that must be reimplanted at the time of surgery."

Although plant microbiomes can alter plant competition in short-term experiments, their relevance to natural temporal patterns in plant communities is unresolved. In a semiarid grassland, the frequency and magnitude of change in plant species composition through time varied from relatively static to highly dynamic among patches across the landscape. We field tested whether these alternative successional trajectories correlated with alternative plant-soil interactions. In temporally stable patches, we found negative plant-soil feedbacks, where plants grew worse with conspecific than heterospecific soil biota-a mechanism that maintains stability in mathematical models. In contrast, feedbacks in temporally dynamic patches were neutral to positive. Importantly, the magnitude of feedbacks depended on plant frequency, enabling plant species to increase in cover when rare, which theory predicts will promote long-term, stable coexistence. Although our study does not determine the direction of causality, our results reveal a novel link between plant-microbe interactions and temporal stability of plant species coexistence and help to explain 20+ yr of plant abundance dynamics at the patch-to-landscape scales."

Therefore, we examined age-related changes in immunoreactivities for GSK3beta and phosphorylated GSK3beta (pGSK3beta) in the central nervous system. In aged rats, there were significant increases in GSK3beta immunoreactivity in the cell bodies and processes of pyramidal cells in most cortical regions. GSK3beta immunoreactivity was also significantly increased in the pyramidal layer of CA1-3 regions, and the granule cell layer of dentate gyrus. Age-related increases were prominent in lateral septal nuclei, compared to the medial septal nuclei. Interestingly, both GSK3beta and pGSK3beta was increased in the prefrontal cortex, while GSK3beta and pGSK3beta was differentially localized in the cerebellar cortex. The first demonstration of age-related alterations in immunoreactivities for GSK3beta and pGSK3beta in the basal forebrain area and cholinergic projection targets may provide useful data for investigating the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases including AD."

Some analgesics, particularly pregabalin and most of the studied antidepressants, were positively associated with COVID-19 incidence, whereas duloxetine presented a negative association. Oral bisphosphonates, vitamin D, thiazide diuretics, anti-hypertensive drugs and chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had no effect on COVID-19 incidence in the studied population. Our results provide novel evidence to support the maintenance of the main anti-osteoporosis treatments in COVID-19 patients, which may be of particular relevance to elderly patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."

AIHA presented at the onset of pSS without overt sicca symptoms in 3 of the 16 patients. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) was more prevalent in the patients with SS-AIHA than in those without (p\u2009=\u20090.007).

The pSS patients with AIHA were more vulnerable to leukopenia and thrombocytopenia than those without AIHA (p\u2009=\u20090.004 and p\u2009=\u20090.001, respectively). Additionally, the levels of complement component 3 (C3) and complement component 4 (C4) were significantly lower in the SS-AIHA group (p\u2009=\u20090.008 and p\u2009=\u20090.037, respectively). Taken together, our results indicate that pSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of AIHA, even in the absence of sicca symptoms. Among pSS patients, the existence of PBC, cytopenia, or hypocomplementemia suggests a higher risk of suffering from AIHA."

Several recent studies have identified novel mechanisms by which viruses engage ETI, highlighting the importance of these immune responses in antiviral defense.

Modern microbial mats (such as the one described here from Matanzas, Cuba) and their fossil counterparts are of great interest in the interpretation of early life on Earth.  Since examination of microbial mats and stromatolites increases our understanding of long-term stability and change, within the global environment, such structures should be protected wherever possible as natural science preserves.

A considerable body of evidence in recent years implicates deregulated expression of a single multi-component enzyme, telomerase, as a causative factor at the heart of immortalization in the vast majority of human tumors. This review highlights the potential of telomerase as a target for novel cancer therapies. The potential of exploiting the selectivity of the telomerase family of genes within cancer cells to develop gene therapy strategies is discussed, and the progress towards translating these novel therapeutics from the laboratory to the clinic is reviewed."

We conducted experiments to elucidate how SuM neurons mediate such effects. Using optogenetics, we found that the excitation of SuM glutamatergic (GLU) neurons was reinforcing in mice; this effect was relayed by their projections to septal GLU neurons. SuM neurons were active during exploration and approach behavior and diminished activity during sucrose consumption. Consistently, inhibition of SuM neurons disrupted approach responses, but not sucrose consumption. Such functions are similar to those of mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Indeed, the stimulation of SuM-to-septum GLU neurons and septum-to-ventral tegmental area (VTA) GLU neurons activated mesolimbic dopamine neurons. We propose that the supramammillo-septo-VTA pathway regulates arousal that reinforces and energizes behavioral interaction with the environment."

The effects of GW501516 were almost completely abrogated by a small interfering RNA against PPAR\u03b4, suggesting that PPAR\u03b4 mediates the effects of GW501516. Activation of PPAR\u03b4 in SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-5 (but not SK-MEL-3) melanoma cell lines also led to significant increases in the expression of Snail mRNA and protein, which mirrored the invasive and migratory potential of these cell lines.

We demonstrate that by leveraging the properties of the SiNWs such as their large specific surface and the high aspect ratio, these nanonet sensors have significantly enhanced sensitivity and better selectivity compared to plane substrates. The fluorescence signal shows an intensity increasing with the SiNW density on the nanonet and for the denser nanonets, the detection limit for DNA hybridization is 1 nM. The elaborated Si nanonet-based DNA sensors present more than 50% change in fluorescence intensity between complementary DNA and 1 base mismatch DNA which shows their high selectivity. Finally, we have integrated the Si nanonet-based sensor into a DNA chip and we have shown that this selective sensor can be reproduced on a large scale area."

Interactions between monocytes and vascular endothelial cells occur early in atherogenesis, and adhesion is mediated by integrins. We evaluated the effects of alpha-tocopherol on expression of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) by monocytes after stimulation with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is implicated as a potent chemotactic agent in atherogenesis. Incubation of whole blood with oxidized LDL (100 microg/ml) increased Mac-1 expression on monocytes, and preincubation with alpha-tocopherol reduced this upregulation in a concentration dependent manner. In another experiment, whole blood was obtained from healthy adult volunteers after 10 days of alpha-tocopherol administration (600 mg/day) and was incubated with oxidized LDL (100 microg/ml). There was a decrease in the upregulation of Mac-1 compared with that measured before administration. Adherence of oxidized LDL-stimulated monocytes to human umbilical vein endothelial cells was reduced by pretreatment with alpha-tocopherol, and was also inhibited by an anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody. Experiments with protein kinase C inhibitors suggested that reduction of Mac-1 upregulation by alpha-tocopherol was secondary to a decrease of protein kinase C activity. In conclusion, alpha-tocopherol suppressed the upregulation of Mac-1 expression on monocytes by oxidized LDL."

        "text": "Most forebrain GABAergic interneurons in rodents are born during embryonic development in the ganglionic eminences (GE) and migrate tangentially into the cortical plate. A subset, however, continues to be generated postnatally in the subventricular zone (SVZ). These interneurons populate the olfactory bulb (OB) reached via migration in the rostral migratory stream (RMS). Employing transgenic mice expressing EGFP in 5-HT(3)-positive neurons, we identified additional migratory pathways in the early postnatal brain. Time-lapse imaging experiments revealed massive migration of EGFP-positive cells from the SVZ into numerous forebrain regions, including cortex, striatum, and nucleus accumbens. The neuronal fate of the migratory EGFP-labeled cells was indicated by their doublecortin (DCX) expression. Birthdating experiments, by using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and retrovirus-based experiments, provided evidence that migrating neuroblasts were born in the SVZ postnatally and developed a distinct GABAergic phenotype. Our results demonstrate that the SVZ is a reservoir of GABAergic interneurons not only for the OB, but also for other cortical and subcortical areas."

It is suggested that this association may be explained on the basis of the selective loss of climbing fibres causing increased firing activity of Purkinje cells with consequent excessive entry of calcium ions. In these circumstances control of calcium ion regulation in the presence of reduced energy production, which is the basis of this metabolic disease, would be expected to put these cells' survival seriously at risk."

Earlier studies have shown that for mood and cognitive benefits to occur, the ratio between TRP and other large neutral amino acids (LNAA) has to be increased by approximately 40\u00a0%. The present study investigated the dose-dependent effects of a TRP-rich hydrolysed protein (egg-protein hydrolysate, EPH) on the plasma TRP:LNAA. Moreover, it was investigated whether EPH could increase TRP:LNAA in the presence of 2\u00a0g of milk protein (MP). In a randomised double-blind crossover design, plasma amino acids were measured every 30\u00a0min for 3\u00b75\u00a0h after ingestion of a drink containing either three different doses of 4, 8 and 12\u00a0g EPH containing 270, 560 or 800\u00a0mg of TRP, respectively, the combination of 4\u00a0g EPH and 2\u00a0g MP (74\u00a0mg TRP), or 4\u00a0g MP (148\u00a0mg TRP) in twenty healthy subjects with a mean age of 52 years. All three EPH doses caused significant increases of TRP:LNAA above 40\u00a0% at 30, 60 and 90\u00a0min after consumption in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with the 4\u00a0g EPH, the increase in TRP:LNAA in the 4\u00a0g EPH with 2\u00a0g MP condition was significantly lower at 60\u00a0min (63 v. 44\u00a0%, P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b7001) and did not differ significantly at 90\u00a0min (58 v. 53\u00a0%, P>0\u00b705). The present study showed that a low dose of 4\u00a0g EPH with even the addition of 2\u00a0g MP was sufficient to increase the ratio of TRP:LNAA above 40\u00a0%. Thus, EPH offers a viable ingredient to increase TRP availability."

The aim of this study was to develop a novel humanized murine model of mixed food and respiratory allergy that recapitulates the human anaphylactic response and to more clearly understand the impact of food allergies on asthma. Immunodeficient mice transferred with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors with peanut and house dust mite (HDM) allergy were exposed and challenged to peanut. Between peanut exposure and challenge, mice were intranasally treated to HDM. Allergic parameters were analyzed. Allergen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E in sera could only be measured in mice treated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) plus allergen. A preceding peanut exposure increased IgE levels, histamine release, bronchial hyper-responsiveness and lung inflammation. Recruitment of inflammatory cells to the airways was aggravated associated with an enhanced T helper type 2 (Th2)/Th17 cytokine secretion when the two allergies were present. A preceding peanut exposure amplifies allergic asthma in this humanized model, which may contribute to the understanding of underlying immunological mechanism of polysensitization occurring in allergic individuals and evaluation of therapeutic interventions."

In contrast, most mucinous carcinomas showed higher cellularity, more single tumour cells, three-dimensional clusters, and mild to marked nuclear atypia. However, MLL with atypical ductal hyperplasia showed cytological features overlapping with mucinous carcinoma. MLL had a non-specific mammographic appearance and showed a cystic lesion on sonography. Mucinous carcinoma appeared as a solid mass on sonography and as a distinct nodule on mammography.

People in power tend to stereotype others more and see them as less human and generally in a more negative way. Powerholders are not more or less accurate in assessing others; rather, the way they understand their power (as responsibility or opportunity) seems to make the difference: Power as responsibility results in better interpersonal accuracy.

Since in this position the influence of chief external determinants of circadian blood pressure variation, i.e. activity and posture, are reduced, it may reveal endogenous oscillatory factors. The effects of 42 days of 6 degrees head-down tilt on the circadian profiles of continuous finger blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were analysed. In seven healthy volunteers (25-31 years) twelve 22 h Portapres registrations were performed: two in an ambulatory baseline period, eight during 42 days of head-down tilt, and two during recovery. Stroke volume was estimated by a pulse contour method ('Modelflow') from the finger arterial blood pressure tracing. Head-down tilt rapidly reduced circadian BP variation, especially for diastolic blood pressure. No effect of long-term head-down tilt on blood pressure level was observed. The day-night difference in heart rate was essentially unaffected. Cardiac output was maintained through an increase of heart rate and simultaneous decline of stroke volume. Our observations confirm the overriding importance of physical activity and orthostatic load on the diurnal variation of BP. The time-frame of the changes in stroke volume and heart rate during head-down tilt might point to a contribution of other factors besides a reduction of circulating blood volume affecting cardiovascular performance under these conditions."

In this paper, the effect of quercetin in Sacharomyces cerevisiae cells submitted to oxidative stress was studied. Hydrogen peroxide resistance increased in cells pretreated with quercetin. Cellular protection was correlated with a decrease in oxidative stress markers, namely, levels of reactive oxygen species, glutathione oxidation, protein carbonylation, and lipid peroxidation. The acquisition of H2O2 resistance was not associated with the induction of antioxidant defenses or with iron chelation. Oxidative stress is a limiting factor for longevity. In agreement, quercetin also increased 60% chronological life span. These results support the utilization of yeast as a useful model to screen in vivo for natural antioxidants with putative health beneficial effects."

ZnO is a material of choice for its semiconducting and photoluminescence properties. In the frame of the nanoarchitectonics concept, we have developed and investigated a new process that relies on direct writing laser patterning in the Deep-UV (DUV) range to prepare photoluminescent microstructures of ZnO at room temperature, under air. This process is based on a synthesis of colloidal ZnO nanocrystals (NCs) with a careful choice of the ligands on the surface to obtain an optimal (i) stability of the colloids, (ii) redissolution of the non-insolated parts and (iii) cross-linking of the DUV-insolated parts. The mechanisms of photocrosslinking are studied by different spectroscopic methods. This room temperature process preserves the photoluminescence properties of the NCs and the wavelength used in DUV allows to reach a sub-micrometer resolution, which opens new perspectives for the integration of microstructures on flexible substrates for optoelectronic applications."

It was observed that a time- and concentration-dependent synthesis of taurine from methionine occurred in the rat lens. The time curve for uptake was linear up to 4 hr and was not saturated up to 40 mM concentration of taurine. The uptake was inhibited by ouabain, cyanide, Ca2+, GTP and cGMP but was not affected by ATP and cAMP. It is suggested that a dual mechanism exists for maintenance of high concentrations of taurine in the lens. Moreover, the uptake mechanism is energy-dependent."

DTMUV is highly contagious and spreads rapidly in many species of ducks. More than 10 million shelducks have been infected and approximately 1 million died in 2010. The disease remains a constant threat to the duck industry; however, it is not known whether DTMUV can infect humans or other mammalians, despite the fact that the virus has spread widely in southeast China, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. The lack of reliable methods to detect the serum antibodies against DTMUV has limited our ability to conduct epidemiological investigations in various natural hosts and to evaluate the efficiency of vaccines to DTMUV."

Although simple to implement and potentially useful to augment many functions, such myoelectric devices still need improvement before they become practical. Here we considered the problem of reconstruction of handwriting from multichannel EMG activity. Previously, linear regression methods (e.g., the Wiener filter) have been utilized for this purpose with some success. To improve reconstruction accuracy, we implemented the Kalman filter, which allows to fuse two information sources: the physical characteristics of handwriting and the activity of the leading hand muscles, registered by the EMG. Applying the Kalman filter, we were able to convert eight channels of EMG activity recorded from the forearm and the hand muscles into smooth reconstructions of handwritten traces. The filter operates in a causal manner and acts as a true predictor utilizing the EMGs from the past only, which makes the approach suitable for real-time operations. Our algorithm is appropriate for clinical neuroprosthetic applications and computer peripherals. Moreover, it is applicable to a broader class of tasks where predictive myoelectric control is needed."

Here, it is shown that these requirements can be satisfied by using the magnetron sputtering, which is well established in the industry.

The fabricated PSCs show a high power conversion efficiency of up to 18.5%, along with negligible hysteresis, improved ambient stability, and high reproducibility. In addition, good uniformity is also demonstrated over an area of 100 cm<sup>2</sup>.

In addition, the average time lost due to illness was 9.23 days for the sick and 7.38 days for their caretakers. Monetary price was a significant (p<0.05) deterrent from visiting health facilities among households with no land or house, the divorced or widowed, and those with annual income less than 500 Birr (62.5 US dollars). The main strategies to cope with the financial costs of illness were waiver privileges, selling household assets, and using savings. Division of labour among household members was used for compensating for the loss of working time due to sickness. The findings of the study indicate that financial and time costs of illness seem to significantly contribute to the impoverishment of rural households."

The cline is spatially and temporally unstable in immigrants, but stable in residents after mortality. Mortality is nonrandom with regard to the Lap locus; genotype-dependent properties of the aminopeptidase enzyme apparently led to a differential rate of the utilizaiton of nutrient reserves because selected genotypes exhibited an increased rate of tissue weight loss.

Closed 500 ml solid-phase reactors were operated to determine whether CaO(2) stimulated the biodegradation of BEHP in saturated soil. Ex situ bioremediation conditions were then simulated by mixing water-saturated soil for 6 h before placing the soil in three vented, 2 l solid-phase reactors for 50 days. Biodegradation of BEHP was quantified using four different measurements of microbial activity: (1) oxygen concentrations in the reactor gas; (2) bacterial colony-forming units (CFU); (3) fungal CFU; and (4) 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride dehydrogenase activity (INT-DHA). CaO(2) released molecular O(2), which retarded dewatering but substantially enhanced BEHP biodegradation. After 20 days, BEHP in the amended reactor was reduced from 20.3 to roughly 5 g kg(-1) vs. 15 g kg(-1) in the reactor without CaO(2). Bacterial growth was favored over fungal growth at elevated moisture and BEHP levels."

The plasma process can be coupled with adsorbent technology by providing steam as the fluid carrier for desorbing the VOCs from an adsorbent. Hence, N2 can be excluded by using a relatively inexpensive carrier gas, and thermal formation of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) is avoided in the plasma. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the technical feasibility of destroying VOCs from gas streams by using a commercially available microwave plasma torch and to examine whether significant byproducts were produced. Trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene (TOL) were added as representative VOCs of interest to a flow that contained Ar as a carrier gas in addition to O2 and steam. The O2 was necessary to ensure that undesirable byproducts were not formed in the process. Microwave power applied at 500-600 W was found to be sufficient to achieve the destruction of the test compounds, down to the detection limits of the gas chromatograph that was used in the analysis. Samples of the postmicrowave gases were collected on sorbent tubes for the analysis of dioxins and other byproducts. No hazardous byproducts were detected when sufficient O2 was added to the flow. The destruction efficiency at a fixed microwave power improved with the addition of steam to the flow that passed through the torch."

Nevertheless, current treatment continues to use short-term applications of 6-TG with only sparse information on toxicity. 6-TG is metabolized by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) which underlies clinically relevant genetic polymorphism. We analyzed the association between hepatic SOS reported as a serious adverse event (SAE) and short-term 6-TG application in 3983 pediatric ALL patients treated on trial AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 (derivation cohort) and defined the role of TPMT genotype in this relationship. We identified 17 patients (0.43%) with hepatic SOS, 13 of which with short-term exposure to 6-TG (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Eight of the 13 patients were heterozygous for low-activity TPMT variants, resulting in a 22.4-fold (95% confidence interval 7.1-70.7; P\u2009\u2264\u20090.0001) increased risk of hepatic SOS for heterozygotes in comparison to TPMT wild-type patients. Results were supported by independent replication analysis. All patients with hepatic SOS after short-term 6-TG recovered and did not demonstrate residual symptoms. Thus, hepatic SOS is associated with short-term exposure to 6-TG during treatment of pediatric ALL and SOS risk is increased for patients with low-activity TPMT genotypes."

The switch from proliferation to meiosis is tightly regulated, and aberrations in switching result in either too little or too much proliferation. To understand the genetic basis of this regulation, we characterized loss-of-function mutations and a novel tumorous allele of Caenorhabditis elegans mett-10, which encodes a conserved putative methyltransferase. We show that METT-10 is a nuclear protein that acts in the germ line to inhibit the specification of germ-cell proliferative fate. METT-10 also promotes vulva, somatic gonad, and embryo development and ensures meiotic development of those germ cells that do differentiate. In addition, phenotypic analysis of a mett-10 null allele reveals that METT-10 enables mitotic cell cycle progression. The finding that METT-10 functions to inhibit germ-cell proliferative fate, despite promoting mitotic cell cycle progression of those germ cells that do proliferate, separates the specification of proliferative fate from its execution."

The complex composed of alpha- and beta-dystroglycan is called the dystroglycan complex. Although defects of the dystroglycan gene have not been identified as the primary causes of hereditary diseases in humans, secondary but significant abnormalities of the dystroglycan complex have been revealed in severe muscular dystrophies, including sarcoglycanopathy (LGMD2C, D, E and F). In this study, we investigated proteolytic processing of beta-dystroglycan and its effect on the extracellular matrix-cell membrane linkage in cardiomyopathic hamsters, the model animals of LGMD2F. Compared to normal controls, proteolytic processing of beta-dystroglycan was activated in the skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles of cardiomyopathic hamsters and this resulted in the partial disruption of the dystroglycan complex in these tissues. These phenomena were observed from the early phase of muscle degeneration process. Our results suggest that proteolytic processing of beta-dystroglycan disrupts the extracellular matrix-cell membrane linkage via the dystroglycan complex and this may play a role in the molecular pathogenesis of muscle degeneration in cardiomyopathic hamsters."

Our present study evaluates changes in IOP during RDT and possible correlations between electrophysiological and tonometrical modifications. In twenty patients undergoing RDT (12 hrs/weekly, mean age 42.05 +/- 10.80 yrs) we performed, just before and immediately after the dialytic session the tonographic recordings and serum osmolality. The pre-dialysis IOP of all 20 patients ranged from 9.00 to 27.19 mmHg with a mean of 16.40 +/- 7.20. Serum osmolality predialysis was 326.10 +/- 5.72 mOsm/l and post-dialysis 290.33 +/- 2.95 mOsm/l. Our studies suggest a correlation between decrease in plasma osmolality and increase in IOP during dialysis. The effect of RDT on IOP depends on the balance between the rise in IOP with the reduction of the concentrations of \"waste products\" and the extracellular volume reduction associated with ultrafiltration. The elevation of IOP may be due to a decrease in post-dialysis outflow facility inducing an osmotic influx of water into the eye because of hyperosmolality of intraocular fluids. These continuous modifications may be partially responsible for the defective propagation and the delayed transmission documented by VEPs."

Bacterial complex I generally contains 14 subunits: 7 hydrophilic proteins located in the peripheral arm and 7 hydrophobic proteins present in the membrane arm. It is the identification of the hydrophobic proteins that makes the characterization of complex I, and of membrane proteins in general, very difficult. In this article, we report the identification of the subunits of complex I from Rhodothermus marinus. The original approach, presented here, combined several protein and peptides separation strategies (different reversed phase materials, high-performance liquid chromatography, and gel electrophoresis) with different identification methods (electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and Edman degradation analysis) and represents a step forward in the characterization of membrane proteins that studies are still technically highly challenging. The combination of the different methodologies allowed the identification of complex I canonical subunits and also a possible novel subunit, namely a pterin-4\u03b1-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD). This was the first time that a PCD was suggested to be part of complex I, and its possible regulatory role is discussed."

We previously identified a cardiac biomechanical stress-regulated complex at the cardiac-specific N2B region of titin that includes four-and-a-half LIM domain protein-1 (Fhl1) and components of the mitogen-activated protein signaling cascade, which impacted muscle compliance in Fhl1 knock-out cardiac muscle. However, direct regulation of these molecular components in mediating titin N2B function remained unresolved. Here we identify Fhl1 as a novel negative regulator of titin N2B levels and phosphorylation-mediated mechanics. We specifically identify titin N2B as a novel substrate of extracellular signal regulated-kinase-2 (Erk2) and demonstrate that Fhl1 directly interferes with Erk2-mediated titin-N2B phosphorylation. We highlight the critical region in titin-N2B that interacts with Fhl1 and residues that are dependent on Erk2-mediated phosphorylation in situ. We also propose a potential mechanism for a known titin-N2B cardiomyopathy-causing mutation that involves this regulatory complex. These studies shed light on a novel mechanism regulating titin-N2B mechano-signaling as well as suggest that dysfunction of these pathways could be important in cardiac disease states affecting muscle compliance."

This process is greatly enhanced by molecular motors that reside within the outer hair cells, but the performance also depends on passive mechanical properties, such as the stiffness, mass, and friction of the structures within the organ of Corti. We used resampled confocal imaging to study the mechanical properties of the low-frequency regions of the cochlea. The data allowed us to estimate an important mechanical parameter, the radial strain, which was found to be 0.1% near the inner hair cells and 0.3% near the third row of outer hair cells during moderate-level sound stimulation. The strain was caused by differences in the motion trajectories of inner and outer hair cells. Motion perpendicular to the reticular lamina was greater at the outer hair cells, but inner hair cells showed greater radial vibration. These differences led to deformation of the reticular lamina, which connects the apex of the outer and inner hair cells. These results are important for understanding how the molecular motors of the outer hair cells can so profoundly affect auditory sensitivity."

The IRC assessments can produce difficulties for trial monitoring given the time lag typically associated with receiving assessments from the IRC. This results in a missing data problem wherein a surrogate measure of response may provide useful information for interim decisions and future monitoring strategies. In this paper, we present statistical tools that are helpful for monitoring a group sequential clinical trial with missing IRC data.

Plasma fluoride concentrations just prior to the daily oral dose were measured at regular intervals. After 112 days post-dose, plasma fluoride levels were measured over a 48-hour period following the daily oral dose or a single intravenous dose. Mean bio-availability factor for the oral dose was 0.3 (range 0.2-0.4), and mean biological half-life was 59 days (range 49-72). Bone fluoride content calculated from the pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma data was similar to the content of fluoride measured in the bone at slaughter. The study showed that accumulation of fluoride in bone influences plasma fluoride levels during chronic administration of fluoride to growing pigs. The long biological half-life found showed that it was not possible to achieve steady-state plasma levels within the six-month experimental period used.

Fifty-two patients in labor were allowed to deliver. The remaining 47 were randomly assigned to either prompt delivery (N = 26) or conservative management (N = 21). The overall corrected perinatal survival was excellent (96%). Only one death in the entire series clearly was due to prematurity. Expectant management prolonged gestation greater than one week in only four of 21 patients (19%), and was associated with a significantly increased risk of maternal infections. There were no failed inductions of labor, and 22 of 24 induced patients (92%) delivered vaginally. Neonatal morbidity was similar in each group. These findings in an indigent, largely black population suggest that when pulmonary maturity is present, the maternal risks of conservative management may exceed the potential benefit to the fetus and newborn. The findings of this study may be specific to the population studied, and extrapolation to dissimilar populations may not be warranted."

This study utilized MRI to document the long-term natural history of asymptomatic osteonecrosis associated with corticosteroid therapy in SLE patients. Two hundred and one SLE patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids were prospectively observed from 1986 to 1997. The inclusion criterion was that patients had received periodic MRI examinations of all their hip and knee joints for \u226510 years. Joints that were already collapsed and symptomatic at the first examination were excluded. Five hundred and thirty-seven joints (251 hips and 286 knees) were identified in 144 patients, with a mean follow-up period of 13.6 years (range, 10-20 years) and a follow-up rate of 73%. Mean age of SLE onset was 26 years, and the mean highest oral corticosteroid dosage was 57 mg/day. Osteonecrosis developed in 238 (44%) of 537 joints. At final follow-up, 117 (49%) of these 238 joints demonstrated spontaneous repair in the necrotic area. Osteonecrosis completely disappeared in 21 joints. Enlargement of osteonecrosis was noted in 35 joints (15%) following increased steroid dosage because of SLE recurrence. Finally, 52 joints (22%) were collapsed. Spontaneous repair of asymptomatic osteonecrosis was observed, whereas enlargement occurred only after corticosteroid dosage increases."

The RNAase III Drosha is a key component for miRNA maturation. To date, however, the roles of Drosha in virus infection remain to be addressed. In this study, the Drosha was characterized in Marsupenaeus japonicus shrimp. The sequence analysis revealed that the shrimp Drosha gene encoded a 1081-amino-acid peptide, which comprised two tandem ribonuclease III C terminal domains and a double-stranded RNA binding motif. The shrimp Drosha was homologous with those of other animal species. The quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the Drosha gene was highly expressed in lymphoid organ and was significantly up-regulated in response to WSSV challenge, suggesting that the Drosha was involved in the antiviral immunity of shrimp. The results showed that the knock down of Drosha gene led to the defect of miRNA maturation, and subsequent higher virus loads in shrimp. Our study presented that Drosha played important roles in the antiviral defense of shrimp."

The latter species is exceedingly rare and its life history is unknown, but L. silvarum is common and was thought to be capable of being either parasitic or saprophytic in North America. Until recently, the anuran parasite Lucilia bufonivora Moniez was thought to be strictly Palearctic, but a study in 2014 has determined this species is established throughout southern Canada. In 2019, a study demonstrated, with molecular and morphological evidence, that two adult flies formerly identified as L. silvarum and reared from amphibian myiasis cases from Canada, are actually L. bufonivora. Although the mentioned study detected relatively high genetic distances with European L. bufonivora, the lack of evident morphological differentiation suggest that they are the same species. The current study examined 12 adult males and eleven adult females morphologically from three additional North American studies. Specimens were examined which had been identified as L. silvarum or L. elongata, and they all proved to be L. bufonivora. We now suspect L. silvarum is strictly saprophagous in North America like they are in the Palearctic Region. We also provide evidence that the pattern of myiasis differs between European and North American specimens."

Establishing the extent of potential differences between laboratory animals and humans, through direct study of human tissues and/or cells, is likely important in facilitating translation of preclinical discoveries to meaningful treatments. Patch-clamp electrophysiology and RNA-sequencing was performed on dorsal root ganglia taken from patients with variable presence of radicular/neuropathic pain. Findings establish that spontaneous action potential generation in dorsal root ganglion neurons is associated with radicular/neuropathic pain and radiographic nerve root compression. Transcriptome analysis suggests presence of sex-specific differences and reveals gene modules and signalling pathways in immune response and neuronal plasticity related to radicular/neuropathic pain that may suggest therapeutic avenues and that has the potential to predict neuropathic pain in future cohorts."

Herein we compared the number of polymorphic loci and alleles per locus, as well as observed heterozygosity in Melipona rufiventris and M. mondury populations, using specific and heterologous primers. The use of specific primers placed in evidence the greater frequency of polymorphic loci and alleles per locus, besides an expressive increase in observed heterozygosity in M. rufiventris and M. mondury, thereby reinforcing the idea that populational studies should be undertaken by preferably using species-specific microsatellite primers."

Here, we describe a nematic colloidal system consisting of mesostructures of gold capable of inducing elastic multipoles of different order. Elastic monopoles are formed by relatively large asymmetric mesoflower particles, for which gravity and elastic torque balancing yields monopole-type interactions. High-order multipoles are instead formed by smaller mesoflowers with a myriad of shapes corresponding to multipoles of different orders, consistent with our computer simulations based on free energy minimization. We reveal unexpected many-body interactions in this colloidal system, ranging from de-mixing of elastic monopoles to a zoo of unusual colloidal crystals formed by high-order multipoles like hexadecapoles. Our findings show that gold mesoflowers may serve as a designer toolkit for engineering colloidal interaction and self-assembly, potentially exceeding that in atomic and molecular systems."

While essentiality is frequently considered a question of a protein's increasing number of interactions, we found that binary-Y2H interactions failed to show such a trend in both organisms. Furthermore, essential genes are enriched in protein complexes in both organisms. In turn, binary-Y2H interactions hold more bottleneck interactions than co-complex interactions while both binary-Y2H and co-complex interactions are strongly enriched among co-regulated proteins and transcription factors.

Large knowledge gaps, however, exist regarding indirect herbicide impacts on primary consumers through changes in the quality of periphyton as a food source (i.e., diet-related effects). To address this gap, the grazer <i>Physella acuta</i> (Gastropoda) was fed for 21 days with periphyton that grew for 15 days in the presence or absence of the herbicide diuron (8 &#956;g/L) to quantify changes in the feeding rate, growth rate, and energy storage (neutral lipid fatty acids; NLFAs) of <i>P. acuta</i>. Periphyton biomass, cell viability, community structure, and FAs served as proxies for food quality that support a mechanistic interpretation of the grazers' responses. Diuron changed the algae periphyton community and fatty acid profiles, indicating alterations in the food quality, which could explain differences in the snails' feeding rate compared to the control. While the snails' growth rate was, despite an effect size of 55%, not statistically significantly changed, NLFA profiles of <i>P. acuta</i> were altered. These results indicate that herbicides can change the food quality of periphyton by shifts in the algae composition, which may affect the physiology of grazers."

Data is based on interviews with 100 Greek families in Montreal and 45 patients in two different clinical settings. Comparing results with material on nervios and nerves from Latin America and the United States, I concur with Low (1985) that nerves should be viewed as a 'culturally-interpreted symptom' rather than a 'culture bound syndrome'. It is further suggested that the importance of social and material conditions and gender relations in mediating the cultural interpretation must be stressed. Failure to do so often results in the medicalization of nevra and the creation of a chronic sick role for the patient."

Samples of aquifer sediment and groundwater from the margin of the phenol plume were used to inoculate anaerobic microcosms enriched in nitrate and pollutant phenols. Rapid degradation of phenol and p-cresol was observed over a 35-day period leading to the generation of inorganic carbon and a number of transient intermediates. O-cresol proved to be recalcitrant on the experimental time-scale. A mass balance calculation shows that, during degradation, carbon was conserved in the aqueous phase. Groundwater-sediment interactions were monitored using carbon stable isotope data. A mass balance for solution TIC indicates thatp-cresol degradation stimulated the dissolution of sedimentary carbonate phases due to the formation of carbonic acid. Compound-specific carbon isotope analysis (GC-IRMS) was used to search for 13C enrichment in residual p-cresol. A slight enrichment trend (epsilon = -2.5/1000) was tentatively identified. The potential of this fractionation effect for obtaining in situ degradation rates is discussed. Results from the microcosm experiments help to explain the observed distribution of nitrate and phenols within the polluted aquifer."

The product presented in this paper provides an alternative to powering portables by converting regular human walking motion to electricity. The device harvests electric power using air bulbs, distributed in the sole of a shoe to drive a series of micro-turbines connected to small DC motors. The number and position of air bulbs is optimized to harvest the maximum airflow from each foot-strike. The system is designed to continuously drive the micro-turbines by utilizing both outflow and inflow from the air bulbs. A prototype combat boot was fitted on the right foot of a 75 kg test subject, and produced an average continuous power on the order of 10 s of mW over a 22 \u03a9 load during walking at 3.0 mph. This combat boot provides enough electric power to a passive GPS tracker that periodically relays geographical coordinates to a smartphone via satellite without battery replacement."

The importance of TBK1 in innate immunity has been demonstrated in mammalian, however the characterization and function of TBK1 in avian remains largely unknown. In this study, we cloned duck TBK1 (duTBK1) from duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) for the first time, which encoded 729 amino acids and had a high amino acid identity with goose and cormorant TBK1s. The duTBK1 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization in DEFs and was extensively expressed in all tested tissues. Overexpression of duTBK1 induced IFN-\u03b2 production through the activation of IRF1 and NF-\u03baB in DEFs. The N-terminal kinase domain and the ubiquitin-like domain in middle of duTBK1 played pivotal roles in IFN-\u03b2 induction as well as in IRF1 and NF-\u03baB activation. Furthermore, knockdown of duTBK1 by small interfering RNA significantly decreased poly(I:C)- or Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFN-\u03b2 expression. In addition, duTBK1 expression dramatically reduced the replication of both duck reovirus (DRV) and duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) in DEFs. These results suggested that the duTBK1 played a pivotal role in mediating duck antiviral innate immunity."

In the juvenile monkey staining for types I and III collagen was weak in the fibrous tissue layer, intense in the pre-cartilaginous tissue layer and faint in the cartilaginous tissue layer; staining was significantly more intense in the posterosuperior and posterior regions than in the anterior region. Similarly, staining for cartilage-characteristic extracellular matrices, including type II collagen and keratan sulfate, was intense in the cartilaginous tissue layer of the posterior condyle. In contrast, in the late-adolescent monkey staining for the extracellular matrices was more intense in the anterior half of the condyle (i.e. from the anterior to the posterosuperior region) than in the posterior region, and most intense in the posterosuperior region. The results demonstrate that marked regional differences exist in the phenotypic expression of the extracellular matrices in the mandibular condyles of growing monkeys and that these differences vary between different developmental stages. The variations probably reflect the predominance of competing growth and articulatory functions in the mandibular condyles."

Differentiation between the types was not possible in 84 melanomas (4%). By correlating type of melanoma with various clinical and histological features, it was found that the 3 types differed significantly from one another with regard to growth rate of tumor, antecedent nevus, dominant type of invasive tumor cell, and prognosis. The study thus supported the basic principle of the classification employed, that the 3 histological types represent distinct entities of cutaneous melanoma with different clinical, cellular, and behavioral characteristics. As originally described by Clark, the growth rate was greatest for nodular melanoma, followed by superficial spreading melanoma, and least for lentigo maligna melanoma. It is recommended that this classification be employed in the histological typing of cutaneous melanoma as 1) it is readily applied to the vast majority of melanomas, and 2) it seems to delineate separate clinico-pathologic entities of cutaneous melanoma, which might be correlated with aetiological differences."

Previous work has established that cII activity is regulated through the turnover of cII protein; the products of the hflA and hflB loci of Escherichia coli are needed for a degradative reaction, and lambda cIII functions in stabilizing cII. By using the cloned hflA locus, we have purified a cII-cleaving enzyme that we term HflA. Purified HflA contains three polypeptides; at least two of the subunits are products of the hflA region, and the third is probably a cleavage product of the larger of these two hflA-encoded polypeptides. The HflA protease activity cleaves cII to small fragments. We conclude that the switch between lambda developmental pathways involves regulated cleavage of cII by the specific protease HflA."

Regenerated limbs showed varying degrees of abnormality in their dorsal-ventral organization. Following regeneration, the original dorsal-ventral discontinuities were in some cases maintained and in others resolved. The maintenance or resolution of pattern discontinuities occurred in a position-dependent manner. Cell marker analysis indicates a relationship between the resolution of discontinuities and the extent to which cells become displaced across the original graft-host interface.

This hypothesis was tested in a study using rabbits made temporarily haemophilic by the injection of antibodies against FVIII. These rabbits were given i.v. injections of anti-TFPI IgG antibodies and 40 min later bleeding was initiated by cutting the nail including the apex of the cuticle. Injection of anti-TFPI IgG shortened the bleeding time significantly from 26 min to 11 min (normal mean bleeding time in non-haemophilia rabbits: 5 min). Treatment with anti-TFPI IgG also resulted in a shortening of the haemophilic aPTT to a level slightly longer than the normal aPTT. In addition, the prolonged dilute TF clotting time was shortened by the anti-TFPI IgG treatment. Thus, both bleeding and coagulation parameters indicated that blocking of TFPI may be potentially haemostatic in haemophilia."

Of these variations, the lack of fucose strongly enhances binding to the human Fc\u03b3RIII, a finding which is currently used to improve the efficacy of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. The influence of the other glycan traits is largely unknown, mostly due to lack of glyco-engineering tools. We describe general methods to produce recombinant proteins of any desired glycoform in eukaryotic cells. Decoy substrates were used to decrease the level of fucosylation or galactosylation, glycosyltransferases were transiently overexpressed to enhance bisection, galactosylation and sialylation and in vitro sialylation was applied for enhanced sialylation. Combination of these techniques enable to systematically explore the biological effect of these glycosylation traits for IgG and other glycoproteins."

Despite these advances, knowledge of the intrinsic genetic programs is still limited and it remains obscure whether the expression of a single transcription factor is sufficient to activate transcriptional programs that ultimately enable midline crossing. Here, we show in the mouse that the homeodomain transcription factor Dbx1 is expressed by a subset of progenitor cells that give rise to commissural neurons in the dorsal midbrain. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses indicate that the expression of Dbx1 alone is sufficient and necessary to trigger midline crossing in vivo. We also show that Robo3 controls midline crossing as a crucial downstream effector of the Dbx1-activated molecular programs. Furthermore, Dbx1 suppresses the expression of the transcriptional program for ipsilateral neuron differentiation in parallel. These results suggest that a single transcription factor, Dbx1, has an essential function in assigning midline-crossing identity, thereby contributing crucially to the establishment of the wiring laterality in the developing nervous system."

Other trends included increases in self-rated craving by induced anxiety and increases in withdrawal symptoms by induced anger. These results suggest that negative mood states, perhaps in the context of repeated attempts at self-medication, may become conditioned stimuli capable of triggering craving and other drug-related conditioned responses.

This dyslipidemic profile is also strongly linked to other features of the metabolic syndrome. Diabetic dyslipidemia is a well-recognized risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Currently, statins remain the first line therapy primarily through reducing the atherogenic LDL. Clinical trials on other lipid modifying agents were met with variable success in selective patient populations. Emerging new insights into the pathophysiology of lipid metabolism, in general, and diabetic dyslipidemia, in particular, have opened up potentially novel therapeutic strategies to further reduce the risk associated with diabetic dyslipidemia and insulin resistant state."

GCs play an important role in the growth and development of the follicle. They are subject to increased attention since it has recently been shown that the subpopulation of GCs within the growing follicle possesses exceptionally plasticity showing stem cell characteristics. In assisted reproduction programs, oocytes are retrieved from patients together with GCs, which are currently discarded daily, but could be an interesting subject to be researched and potentially used in regenerative medicine in the future. Isolated GCs expressed stem cell markers such as OCT-4, NANOG and SOX-2, showed high telomerase activity, and were in vitro differentiated into other cell types, otherwise not present within ovarian follicles. Recently another phenomenon demonstrated in GCs is transdifferentiation, which could explain many ovarian pathological conditions. Possible applications in regenerative medicine are also given."

In all, 21 patients (14 male, seven female; 10 acute leukaemia, eight myelodysplastic syndrome, two non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, one Hodgkin's disease) were treated. The median age was 51 years (range 30-55 years). All patients achieved full donor-type chimaerism. Adverse events included mild nausea and vomiting in two patients and a slight increase of serum amylase in three. A total of 13 patients received RBC transfusions (median 6 U, range 1-23), and all received platelets (median 4 U, range 1-27). Four patients died of nonrelapse causes and five of relapse. The 1-year probabilities of transplant-related mortality and relapse were 19 and 29%, respectively. In total, 12 patients remain in complete remission (median follow-up: 786 days). The 3-year overall survival probability was 58%. We conclude that this regimen is feasible and well tolerated."

Sphingomonas desiccabilis enhanced mean leached concentrations of REEs compared to non-biological controls in all gravity conditions. No significant difference in final yields was observed between gravity conditions, showing the efficacy of the process under different gravity regimens. Bacillus subtilis exhibited a reduction in bioleaching efficacy and Cupriavidus metallidurans showed no difference compared to non-biological controls, showing the microbial specificity of the process, as on Earth. These data demonstrate the potential for space biomining and the principles of a reactor to advance human industry and mining beyond Earth."

All TRPV subfamily members contain an intracellular N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD), a prevalent protein interaction motif. The 1.6-A crystal structure of the TRPV2-ARD, with six ankyrin repeats, reveals several atypical structural features. Repeats one through three display unusually long and flexible fingers with a large number of exposed aromatic residues, whereas repeats five and six have unusually long outer helices. Furthermore, a large counterclockwise twist observed in the stacking of repeats four and five breaks the regularity of the domain, altering the shape of surfaces available for interactions with proteins or other cellular ligands. Both solution studies and crystal packing interactions indicate that the TRPV2-ARD does not form homo-oligomers, suggesting that the ARD of TRPV ion channels may be used for interactions with regulatory factors rather than in promoting tetrameric assembly of the ion channels."

The aim of the research described in this paper was to gain further insight in distribution profile of the ORF3 product encoded by the vitiviruses Grapevine virus A (GVA) and Grapevine virus B (GVB). Expression of the GVA MP-GFP fusion protein via the virus genome in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves resulted in the formation of irregular spots and fibrous network structures on the outermost periphery of epidermal cells. Expression of GVA MP-GFP and GVB MP-GFP was involved in the formation of the tubule-like and punctate structures on the periphery of N. benthamiana and Vitis vinifera protoplasts. Co-expression of the GVA MP-GFP and GVA MP-RFP in protoplasts resulted in co-localization of these proteins into the same punctate structures, indicating that the MP is not accumulated randomly onto the cell surface, but targeted to particular sites at the cell periphery, where punctate and tubule-like structures are likely formed. With the use of cytoskeleton and secretory pathway inhibitors, we showed that the cytoskeletal elements are not likely to be involved in targeting of the MP-GFP to the punctate cellular structures. In addition to MP, a functional coat protein was found to be essential for virus spread within inoculated leaves."

The latter comprised injuries from 1995 only. During the seven-year period 1,468 injuries from fitness training occurred in male firemen. With an estimated 147 h per man and year the injury incidence was 2.6 per 10,000 h of exposure. The mean number of days of absence from work was 24.1 days (SD 39.8). In 1995, the mean cost per injury for medical treatment was close to 7,000 Euro and for production loss almost 4,500 Euro. By far the major part of the injuries, 75 %, occurred during team and contact sports (primarily floorball and soccer) and this sport category also accounted for 83% of the medical costs and 78% of the costs for production loss. It is suggested that a restriction of team and contact sports as mandatory on-duty fitness training for firemen should be tested and evaluated concerning the injury incidence."

For initially isotropic turbulence, we find that the nonlinearity can be insufficient to maintain isotropy, with the energy components parallel to the compression coming to dominate the turbulent energy, with a number of consequences. Among these are the possibilities for stronger and more easily sustained growth of turbulent energy than in 3D compressions and for an increasing turbulent Mach number even in a compression without thermal losses."

Here, we use solution-based metallization to prepare resistive sensing arrays directly on off-the-shelf nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) gloves. The NBR glove acts as the wearable platform while its surface roughness enhances the sensitivity of the overlying sensing array. The NBR sensors have a sheet resistance of 3.1\u00a0\u00b1 0.6\u00a0\u03a9/sq and a large linear working range (two linear regions \u226470%). When stretched, the rough NBR substrate facilitates microcrack formation in the overlying metal, enabling high gauge factors (62 up to 40% strain, 246 from 45 - 70% strain) that are unprecedented for metal film sensors. We apply the sensing array to dynamically monitor gestures for gesture differentiation and robotic control."

Decapsulated DRG explants embedded into type I collagen gels were cultured for 3 days in serum-free medium during which ScC migrated from the explant. These explants were then grown in serum-supplemented medium to allow ScC proliferation. On day 10 the number of ScC isolated from DRG explants per mouse was about 2.5 x 10(5), and the purity was greater than 95%. This culture system provided sufficient numbers of highly purified adult ScC in a shorter culture period (2-3 times) than other methods. We used ScC from this method to determine the age-related changes in attachment, growth, and survival of ScC cultured in serum-free medium. The attachment capacity of adult ScC on type I collagen or polylysine was similar to that of newborn ScC. However, the collagen promoted growth and survival of adult ScC but not that of neonatal ScC, indicating age-related differences of ScC properties in vitro."

The fraction composed mainly of negatively charged phospholipids (NAT 89) was the most efficient source for exoprotein secretion by Phanerochaete chrysosporium INA-12. The results of biochemical marker assays and ultrastructural morphology determination by electron microscopy were correlated. Activities of succinate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial marker, and cytochrome c oxidoreductase, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker, were increased 1.3- and 2.2-fold, respectively, in the presence of NAT 89. Electron microscopy observations suggested that the amount of mitochondria and ER in culture containing phospholipids was increased at the optimum day of lignin peroxidase production. Therefore, phospholipids enhanced energetic metabolism of strain INA-12 and markedly modified fungus physiology. Since ER is involved in enzyme synthesis, we suggest that its increased amount in mycelium cultured with NAT 89 is directly associated with the higher production of lignin peroxidase."

The only significant association between brain tumour risk and alkylating agent dose was in relation to compounds used (bleomycin, chloraminophen) that are thought not to deliver substantial doses to the brain; the statistical significance of the trend with dose depended on a single case, and thus must be considered a weak result."

MutS is the primary mismatch sensor and forms an asymmetric dimer that encircles DNA to bend it to scan for mismatches. The mechanism utilized to load DNA into the central tunnel was unknown and the origin of the force required to bend DNA was unclear. We show that, in absence of DNA, MutS forms a symmetric dimer wherein a gap exists between the monomers through which DNA can enter the central tunnel. The comparison with structures of MutS-DNA complexes suggests that the mismatch scanning monomer (Bm) will move by nearly 50 \u00c5 to associate with the other monomer (Am). Consequently, the N-terminal domains of both monomers will press onto DNA to bend it. The proposed mechanism of toroid formation evinces that the force required to bend DNA arises primarily due to the movement of Bm and hence, the MutS dimer acts like a pair of pliers to bend DNA. We also shed light on the allosteric mechanism that influences the expulsion of adenosine triphosphate from Am on DNA binding. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insight regarding the primary event in MMR i.e. the assembly of the MutS-DNA complex."

Over a longer timescale (15-33 Myr), the inner planets grew by incorporation of these smaller objects through collisions. Processes operating on such asteroids strongly influenced the final composition of these planets, including Earth. Currently there is little agreement about the nature of asteroidal igneous activity: proposals range from small-scale melting, to near total fusion and the formation of deep magma oceans. Here we report a study of oxygen isotopes in two basaltic meteorite suites, the HEDs (howardites, eucrites and diogenites, which are thought to sample the asteroid 4 Vesta) and the angrites (from an unidentified asteroidal source). Our results demonstrate that these meteorite suites formed during early, global-scale melting (> or = 50 per cent) events. We show that magma oceans were present on all the differentiated Solar System bodies so far sampled. Magma oceans produced compositionally layered planetesimals; the modification of such bodies before incorporation into larger objects can explain some anomalous planetary features, such as Earth's high Mg/Si ratio."

B. brevis spores were slightly more sensitive to UVB and UVC than the spores of B. atrophaeus. Photocatalytic sterilization against spores was strongest in UVC and UVB and weakest in UVA. The rate of inactivation of Bacillus spores was significantly increased by the presence of TiO(2), but was not markedly different from that induced by the presence of Ag.

This has resulted in vast opportunities such as providing AI models that are robust to variations with generalizability for instantaneous image quality control, aiding in the acquisition of optimal images and diagnosis of complex diseases, and improving the clinical workflow of cardiac ultrasound.

The flow is modelled by the Oldroyd-B (OB) model coupled with the Poisson-Boltzmann model. EOF of polyacrylamide (PAA) solution is studied as a function of the PAA concentration and the applied electric field. In contrast to steady EOF of Newtonian fluid, the EOF of PAA solution becomes unstable when the applied electric field (PAA concentration) exceeds a critical value for a fixed PAA concentration (electric field), and vortices form at the upstream of the constriction. EOF velocity of viscoelastic fluid becomes spatially and temporally dependent, and the velocity at the exit of the constriction microchannel is much higher than that at its entrance, which is in qualitative agreement with experimental observation from the literature. Under the same apparent viscosity, the time-averaged velocity of the viscoelastic fluid is lower than that of the Newtonian fluid."

In water this model molecule exhibits intramolecular ring-ring stacking interactions as evidenced by UV and NMR spectroscopies. Irradiation at 365 nm at usual concentrations (greater than or equal to 5.10(-4) M) leads exclusively to a regio- and stereo-selective dimerization reaction involving the 3,4 double bonds of the psoralen moities. Extreme dilutions (ca less than or equal to 2.10(-5) M) were necessary to observe the intramolecular reaction which results in the exclusive formation of a 3,4 cis-anti adduct. This reaction is completely reversed by irradiation at 254 nm. These results are discussed with regard to the behavior of the homologous models in which the furan part of the psoralen ring is not hydrogenated. These latter compounds also lead exclusively to a 3,4 cis-anti adduct. It appears that saturation of the furan ring increases strongly the quantum yield of the photoaddition at 365 nm (0.01----0.18) and that the triplet excited state of the 4',5'-dihydropsoralen is involved in the photoaddition."

Formation of the microvessels reactivity during various age periods and maturation of mechanisms of the compensatory-adaptive reactions are connected with formation of the definitive composition of the microcirculatory bed, that in girls corresponds to 11-12 years. Qualitative transformations in the skin capillary network bring certain quantitative changes in the structural microcirculatory parameters--increasing diameter of microvessels and increasing density of functioning capillaries."

We used a modification of this well-known flap as musculocutaneous and fascia flap for a composite reconstruction of groin and urogenital defect. We reconstructed the groin defect with musculocutaneous part of the flap, and the defect over neourethra with the fascial extension and grafting. The aim of this modification was to reconstruct a genital defect with a thin and more pliable tissue to overcome the problem of distortion, kinking and thickness of the flap."

Their cases were not accompanied by any relevant etiology or definite abdominal symptoms. All of the three cases exhibited a benign clinical course. The three patients underwent an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan as part of a health check-up program, which incidentally revealed free air in the right paracolic gutter without evidence of visceral perforation or inflammation. Among the three cases, two patients underwent colonoscopy before abdominal CT, whereas one patient did not. Two cases were completely asymptomatic and were observed without any treatment in the outpatient clinic. Only the third case with minimal symptoms was treated conservatively for a short time. If a small amount of free air typically located in the right paracolic gutter is detected in the absence of perforation during colonoscopy, close observation without unnecessary treatment would be sufficient."

Neuroscientists are merely starting to understand how coherent oscillations might encode information in the human motor system (\"sensorimotor binding\") and how well this can be measured from the surface EEG. However, interregional coherence is a potentially independent mechanism that can, up to now, only be investigated with electrophysiological techniques such as EEG and MEG. The studies reviewed below focus on coherence of finger movements and motor learning: increasing complexity of a movement sequence, internal rhythm generation, visuomotor integration, deficits in interhemispheric coupling, and bimanual coordination. Evidence is presented for a special functional significance of TRCoh in the beta frequency range (13 to 21 Hz) for information processing in large-scale sensorimotor networks during motor tasks."

The effect of hydrophobic BAs, in particular, can be linked with cancer in several digestive (mainly oesophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, biliary tract, colon) and extra-digestive organs (i.e. prostate, breast) through a complex series of mechanisms including direct oxidative stress with DNA damage, apoptosis, epigenetic factors regulating gene expression, reduced/increased expression of nuclear receptors (mainly farnesoid X receptor, FXR) and altered composition of gut microbiota, also acting as a common interface between environmental factors (including diet, lifestyle, exposure to toxics) and the molecular events promoting cancerogenesis. Primary prevention strategies (i.e. changes in dietary habits and lifestyle, reduced exposure to environmental toxics) mainly able to modulate gut microbiota and the epigenome, and the therapeutic use of hydrophilic BAs to counterbalance the negative effects of the more hydrophobic BAs might be, in the near future, part of useful tools for cancer prevention and management."

The initial diagnosis and surveillance of BC require a combination of invasive and non-invasive methods, which are costly and suffer from several limitations. Cystoscopy with urine cytology and histological examination presents the standard diagnostic approach. Various biomarkers (e.g., proteins, genes, and RNAs) have been extensively studied in relation to BC. However, the new trend of liquid biopsy slowly proves to be almost equally effective. Cell-free DNA, non-coding RNA, and other subcellular structures are now being tested for the best predictive and diagnostic value. In this review, we focused on published gene mutations, especially in DNA fragments, but also epigenetic modifications, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecules acquired by liquid biopsy. We performed an online search in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using the terms \"bladder cancer\", in combination with \"markers\" or \"biomarkers\" published until August 2022. If applicable, we set the sensitivity and specificity threshold to 80%. In the era of precision medicine, the development of complex laboratory techniques fuels the search and development of more sensitive and specific biomarkers for diagnosis, follow-up, and screening of BC. Future efforts will be focused on the validation of their sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, and their utility in everyday clinical practice."

However, it can be difficult to establish a causal relationship between the bidirectionality of synaptic plasticity and bidirectional changes in the speed of actual movements. We asked whether metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) receptors, which participate in cerebellar long-term depression (LTD), are necessary for bidirectional motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Cerebellar LTD and long-term potentiation (LTP) are thought to cause increases and decreases, respectively, in the gain of the VOR; the direction of learning depends on the behavioral protocol. We injected either the mGluR1 agonist (S)-DHPG or the antagonist YM 298198 bilaterally into the flocculus of alert cats, and then induced motor learning. In the presence of YM 298198, the VOR gain decreased in gain-up, as well as in gain-down protocols. (S)-DHPG augmented gain-up learning. Gain-down learning was not significantly affected by either drug. These results supported the hypothesis that gain-up learning relies on cerebellar LTD, but gain-down learning relies on a different mechanism. In the absence of mGluR1 activity, cerebellar LTD may be replaced with LTP, permitting learning in only one direction."

Pregnant dams orally received GEN (1 or 10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (1 ml/kg/day) from gestation day 10 to postnatal day 14. In order to assess the effects of GEN on rat offspring, we used a battery of behavioral tests, including the open-field, elevated plus-maze, MAZE and step-through passive avoidance tests. MAZE test is an appetite-motivation test, and we used this mainly for assessing spatial learning and memory. In the MAZE test, GEN groups exhibited shorter latency from start to goal than the vehicle-treated group in both sexes. On the other hand, performances in the step-through passive avoidance test were non-monotonically inhibited by GEN in both sexes, and a significant difference was observed in low dose of the GEN-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated group in female rats. Furthermore, we found that perinatal exposure to GEN did not significantly alter locomotor activity or emotionality as assessed by the open-field and elevated-plus maze tests. These results suggest that perinatal exposure to GEN improved spatial learning and memory of rat offspring, but impaired their passive avoidance learning and memory."

This behavior results from thermally disconnected, but electrically connected, junctions in the nanotube network, which makes it feasible to tune the properties in favor of a higher thermoelectric figure of merit. With a CNT concentration of 20 wt %, these composites exhibit an electrical conductivity of 4800 S/m, thermal conductivity of 0.34 W/m x K and a thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) greater than 0.006 at room temperature.

Since 2008 a device that claims to be the memristor is on the prowl, seeking recognition as a fundamental circuit element, sometimes wanting electronics textbooks to be rewritten, always promising remarkable digital, analog and neuromorphic computing possibilities. A systematic discussion about the fundamental nature of the device is almost absent within the memristor community. Advocates use incomplete constitutive relationships, ignore concepts of activity/passivity and aver that nonlinearity is central to their case. Few researchers have examined these claims. Our report investigates the assertion that the memristor is a fundamental passive circuit element, from the fresh perspective that electrical engineering is the science of charge management. We demonstrate with a periodic table of fundamental elements that the 2008 memristor is not the 1971 postulate and neither of them is fundamental. The ideal memristor is an unphysical active device and any physically realizable memristor is a nonlinear composition of resistors with active hysteresis. We also show that there exists only three fundamental passive circuit elements."

In parallel with the ongoing world effort to identify therapeutic solutions, there is a critical need for improvement in the prognosis of COVID-19. Here, we report plasma proteome fingerprinting that predict high (hospitalized) and low-risk (outpatients) cases of COVID-19 identified by a platform that combines machine learning with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry analysis. Sample preparation, MS, and data analysis parameters were optimized to achieve an overall accuracy of 92%, sensitivity of 93%, and specificity of 92% in dataset without feature selection. We identified two distinct regions in the MALDI-TOF profile belonging to the same proteoforms. A combination of SDS-PAGE and quantitative bottom-up proteomic analysis allowed the identification of intact and truncated forms of serum amyloid A-1 and A-2 proteins, both already described as biomarkers for viral infections in the acute phase. Unbiased discrimination of high- and low-risk COVID-19 patients using a technology that is currently in clinical use may have a prompt application in the noninvasive prognosis of COVID-19. Further validation will consolidate its clinical utility."

The CAR in each mRNA is unexpectedly large, ranging in size from \u223c160 to 285 nt. Here, we identified one or more copies of a 10-nt consensus sequence in each CAR. To determine whether this element (designated CAR-E) functions in cytoplasmic accumulation of intronless mRNA, we multimerized the most conserved CAR-E and inserted it upstream of \u03b2-globin cDNA, which is normally retained/degraded in the nucleus. Significantly, the tandem CAR-E, but not its antisense counterpart, rescued cytoplasmic accumulation of \u03b2-globin cDNA transcripts. Moreover, dinucleotide mutations in the CAR-E abolished this rescue. We show that the CAR-E, but not the mutant CAR-E, associates with components of the TREX mRNA export machinery, the Prp19 complex and U2AF2. Moreover, knockdown of these factors results in nuclear retention of the intronless mRNAs. Together, these data suggest that the CAR-E promotes export of intronless mRNA by sequence-dependent recruitment of the mRNA export machinery."

Five pairs of SAP patients and healthy controls were screened by an Agilent microarray (human lncRNA + mRNA Array V4.0). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the lncRNA expression levels in 50 SAP and 50 controls. Data analyses were performed using R and Bioconductor. A total of 1871 up- and 231 down-regulated lncRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Microarray analysis results identified the lncRNAs NR_037652.1, ENST00000607654.1, ENST00000589524.1 and uc004bhb.3, which were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Among screened lncRNAs, the annotation result of their co-expressed mRNAs showed that the most significantly related pathways were the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway, apoptosis and the p53 signalling pathway, while the main significantly related diseases were the cholesterol, calcium and coronary disease. Our study indicated that clusters of lncRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between SAP patients and matched controls. These lncRNAs may play a significant role in SAP development and could serve as biomarkers and potential targets for the future treatment of SAP."

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) formed in excess after TBI synergistically contribute to secondary brain damage together with lipid peroxidation products (reactive aldehydes) and inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation potentiate each other. Following TBI, excessive oxidative stress overloads the endogenous cellular antioxidant system leading to cell death. To combat oxidative stress, several antioxidant therapies were tested in preclinical animal models of TBI. These include free radical scavengers, activators of antioxidant systems, Inhibitors of free radical generating enzymes and antioxidant enzymes. Many of these therapies showed promising outcomes including reduced edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) protection, smaller contusion volume, and less inflammation. In addition, many antioxidant therapies also promoted better sensory, motor, and cognitive functional recovery after TBI. Overall, preventing oxidative stress is a viable therapeutic option to minimize the secondary damage and to improve the quality of life after TBI."

Studies in patients with AF have shown that structural changes occur in the atria, but the relationship between the structural remodelling and the chronicity of the arrhythmia are not well understood. The changes mainly concern adaptive (dedifferentiation of cardiomyocytes) and maladaptive (degeneration of cells with replacement fibrosis) features. In order to characterise the time course of the structural remodelling the need for animal models which adequately mimic chronic atrial fibrillation in humans is felt essential. In this review, the structural changes that are observed during prolonged sustained AF in patients and animal models, are described.

None of the 114 eyes had a history of retinal detachment prior to nor at the time of anterior segment surgery. There were 37 cases of trauma in this series. Follow-up varied from 1 to 66 months with 58% of cases having a follow-up of greater than one year. There was a 10.50% post-operative retinal detachment rate (12/114 eyes). Seven detachments occurred in the 37 traumatized eyes (19.10%) versus 5 detachments in 77 non-traumatized eyes (6.49%). Of the 12 detachments, 7 presented signs of severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) while the remaining 5 detachments appeared to be uncomplicated. No detachment was related to an iatrogenic tear and no case of PVR seemed to be related to the sclerotomy site. Successful reattachment was achieved in 3 out of 4 uncomplicated cases and 3 out of 5 cases with PVR. Vitrectomy and posterior capsulectomy are often mandatory in anterior segment problems: pupillary membranes, secondary cataracts, lens ectopiae and dislocations, vitreous wick and vitreocorneal touch. In our opinion other indications for vitrectomy and posterior capsulectomy are congenital, juvenile and post-uveitis cataracts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Twelve subjects with asthma, 13 subjects with COPD, and 10 healthy individuals enrolled in the study. Bronchial biopsies were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and anti-TGF beta1 antibody. As a result, immunoreactive TGF beta1 was mainly localized in association with connective tissue in all groups. The staining intensity was not statistically different among the groups in bronchial epithelium, whereas it was significantly higher in the group of asthma in the submucosa. Because there is evidence showing a significant increase of staining intensity in the submucosa from asthmatics but not from subjects with COPD, we may conclude that TGF beta1 may play a significant role in pathogenesis of asthma but not in COPD."

While in animal cells and yeast, the actin cytoskeleton is instrumental in the execution of cytokinesis, in plant cells the microtubule cytoskeleton is taking the lead in spatially controlling and executing cytokinesis by the formation of two unique, plant-specific arrays, the preprophase band (PPB) and the phragmoplast. The formation of microtubule arrays in plant cells is contingent on acentrosomal microtubule nucleation. At the onset of mitosis, the PPB defines the plane of cell division where the partitioning cell wall is later constructed by the cytokinetic phragmoplast, imposing a spatio-temporal relationship between the two processes. Current research progress in the field of plant cell division focuses on identifying and tying the links between early and late events in spatial control of cytokinesis and how microtubule array formation is regulated in plant cells."

In the present paper, we report the effect of inostamycin on the serum-induced activation of Ser/Thr protein kinases that are involved in G1 progression. In quiescent NRK cells mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) and casein kinase II were activated within 15 min after serum addition. Neither activation was affected by the treatment with inostamycin. However, in the inostamycin-treated cell, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) failed to be activated after serum stimulation. Since serum-induced expression of cyclin E was also suppressed by inostamycin, this inhibitor would appear to block CDK2 activation by inhibiting cyclin E expression. Furthermore, inostamycin also inhibited cyclin D1 expression induced by serum; and consequently, hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) by RB-kinases such as CDK4 and CDK2 was abolished, which would result in elimination of functional inactivation of pRB. Thus, early G1 arrest in NRK cells by inostamycin is due to the inhibition of cyclin D1 and E expressions."

To search for intracellular protein components that interact with M1 protein and explore the potential roles of these interactions in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection, 11 independent proteins, including hTFIIIC102-s protein, encoding a short isoform of the TFIIIC102 subunit of the human TFIIIC transcription factor, were screened from a human cell cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid technique. The interaction between M1 protein and hTFIIIC102-s was studied in more detail. Mapping assays showed that the N-terminal globular region (amino acids 1-164) of the M1 protein and the five tandem tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR1-5, amino acids 149-362) in hTFIIIC102-s were necessary for the interaction. The interaction was confirmed by both glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation assays. In addition, coexpression of hTFIIIC102-s with M1 in HeLa cells inhibited the translocation of M1 into the nucleus. Taken together, the present data indicate that hTFIIIC102-s can interact with the structural M1 protein of the influenza virus, which provides a novel clue toward further understanding of the roles of M1 protein in the interactions between influenza virus and host cells."

Using a multi-cellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) model, results show that CB1a is potent in preventing the growth of lung cancer tumor-like growths in vitro.

While factors that seem to influence \u03b2-cell proliferation in specific contexts have been described, reliable stimulation of human \u03b2-cell proliferation has remained a challenge. Importantly, \u03b2-cells exist in the context of a complex, integrated pancreatic islet microenvironment where they interact with other endocrine cells, vascular endothelial cells, extracellular matrix, neuronal projections and islet macrophages. This review highlights different components of the pancreatic microenvironment, and reviews what is known about how signaling that occurs between \u03b2-cells and these other components influences \u03b2-cell proliferation. Future efforts to further define the role of the pancreatic islet microenvironment on \u03b2-cell proliferation may lead to the development of successful approaches to increase or restore \u03b2-cell mass in diabetes."

Desciclovir, an oral prodrug of acyclovir which is metabolized to acyclovir in vivo, allows treatment of virus infections per os, where high serum levels are needed, e.g. in Epstein-Barr virus infections. BW B759U, another analogue of acyclovir, has been used for the treatment of life-threatening or sight-threatening cytomegalovirus infections in AIDS patients. More than 80% of the patients treated for retinitis experienced stabilization or clinical improvement. Antiviral efficacy was demonstrated in 73% of the patients. Azidothymidine, a nucleoside analogue of thymidine, has been developed specifically to treat the HIV infection. Its antiviral activity is based on inhibition of reverse transcriptase. Phase I studies have demonstrated that azidothymidine is well tolerated. Its ability to cross the blood brain barrier makes it an attractive candidate for treatment of HIV.

The adult worm antigen of S. japonicum (SjAg) was adsorbed passively on the walls of a polystyrene microwell and then reacted with the desired SjAb. The colloidal gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was adsorbed on the walls of the polystyrene microwells through the reaction with SjAb, followed by the silver enhancement process, dissolution of silver metal atoms in an acidic solution, and determination of dissolved silver ions by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) at a glassy-carbon electrode. Assay conditions were optimized, including the reaction time of SjAg with SjAb, the interaction of SjAb with the colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibody, the dilution ratio of the colloidal gold-labeled secondary antibody and the silver enhancement time. The integration of the anodic stripping peak current depended linearly on the SjAb logarithmic concentration over the range of 6.4 ng/ml to 100 microg/ml. A detection limit as low as 3.0 ng/ml SjAb was achieved, which was better than the piezoelectric body acoustic wave sensor (detection limit of 7.2 microg/ml) and the renewable amperometric immunosensor (detection limit of 0.36 microg/ml). Rabbit serum samples with various degrees of infection were analyzed, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method meets the requirements of clinical analysis."

The process by which we determined where to place metrics within the accounting framework, which was strongly informed by the National Ecosystem Services Classification System (NESCS), can provide guidance for future ecosystem accounts in the U.S. and other countries. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps that limit the inclusion of certain ecosystem services in the accounts and suggest future research that can close these gaps and improve future U.S. ecosystem accounts."

In this paper, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS)-based metabolomic study was performed to characterize dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced liver fibrosis in rats and evaluate the therapeutic effects of YCHT. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed that the model group was well separated from the control group, whereas the YCHT-treated group exhibited a tendency to restore to the controls. Seven significantly changed fibrosis-related metabolites, including unsaturated fatty acids and lysophosphatidylcholines (Lyso-PCs), were identified. Moreover, statistical analysis demonstrated that YCHT treatment could reverse the levels of most metabolites close to the normal levels. These results, along with histological and biochemical examinations, indicate that YCHT has anti-fibrotic effects, which may be due to the suppression of oxidative stress and resulting lipid peroxidation involved in hepatic fibrogenesis. This study offers new opportunities to improve our understanding of liver fibrosis and the anti-fibrotic mechanisms of YCHT."

However, the precise mechanisms of tumorigenesis of the parathyroids are unknown. Here we have investigated the roles of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and menin, the product of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (Men1) gene, in the proliferation and PTH production of parathyroid cells from either patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism or Men1. TGF-beta was expressed in the parathyroid endocrine cells. Addition of TGF-beta to parathyroid cells from patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism inhibited their proliferation and PTH secretion. These responses to TGF-beta were lost when menin was specifically inactivated by antisense oligonucleotides. Moreover, TGF-beta did not affect the proliferation and PTH production of parathyroid cells from a Men1 patient. These results indicate that menin is required for TGF-beta action in the parathyroid. We conclude that TGF-beta is an important autocrine/paracrine negative regulator of parathyroid cell proliferation and PTH secretion and that loss of TGF-beta signaling due to menin inactivation contributes to parathyroid tumorigenesis."

The Cln3p G(1) cyclin is localized primarily to the nucleus, while Cln2p is localized primarily to the cytoplasm. Both binding to Cdc28p and Cdc28p-dependent phosphorylation in the C-terminal region of Cln2p are independently required for efficient nuclear depletion of Cln2p, suggesting that this process may be physiologically regulated. The accumulation of hypophosphorylated Cln2 in the nucleus is an energy-dependent process, but may not involve the RAN GTPase. Phosphorylation of Cln2p is inefficient in small newborn cells obtained by elutriation, and this lowered phosphorylation correlates with reduced Cln2p nuclear depletion in newborn cells. Thus, Cln2p may have a brief period of nuclear residence early in the cell cycle. In contrast, the nuclear localization pattern of Cln3p is not influenced by Cdk activity. Cln3p localization requires a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) located at the C terminus of the protein. This sequence is required for nuclear localization of Cln3p and is sufficient to confer nuclear localization to green fluorescent protein in a RAN-dependent manner. Mislocalized Cln3p, lacking the NLS, is much less active in genetic assays specific for Cln3p, but more active in assays normally specific for Cln2p, consistent with the idea that Cln3p localization explains a significant part of Clnp functional specificity."

All patients were followed using patient identification code to identify deaths.

Previous studies demonstrated that the non-enzymic formylation of tetrahydrofolate by formyl phosphate occurs exclusively at the more nucleophilic 5-nitrogen in the reduced pyrazine ring. The experiments described in this report were designed to determine whether N5-formyltetrahydrofolate might be the first product to be formed on the enzyme, followed by formyl transfer to the 10-nitrogen via the cyclic intermediate N5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. If this were the case, oxygen from solvent H2O would be incorporated into the formyl group of the N10-derivative. By conducting the reaction in a 1:1 mixture of [16O]H2O and [18O]H2O and using 13C NMR spectroscopy we show that no 18O is incorporated into the product and conclude that the reaction proceeds via a direct formylation of the N-10 position by formyl phosphate."

Moreover, the PAC used in high concentration can largely improve its adsorption performance for ammonia-nitrogen, whose removal rate is 44.5%."

Yet, cases of technological discontinuance are largely ignored in studies of early innovation, as the lack of robust datasets makes identification and analysis difficult. A large-scale geospatial analysis of more than 4500 gold objects from the Caucasus, an early center of gold innovation, shows a precipitous decline at 1500 BC in precisely the places with the earliest global evidence of gold mining (c. 3000 BC). Testing various causal models reveals that social factors, rather than resource limitations or demographic disruption, were the primary causes of this rejection. These results indicate that prior models of technological rejection and loss have underestimated the range of conditions in which they can occur, and provide empirical support for theories of innovation that reject notions about the linearity of technological progress."

Extant research is inconclusive; some research indicates that jurors do follow judicial instructions to ignore inadmissible evidence, but other research suggests that jurors do not. Two experiments examined whether jurors were affected by inadmissible evidence. The results revealed that although mock jurors were biased by inadmissible evidence prior to deliberations, the bias was tempered following deliberations. In Experiment 1, post deliberation jurors disregarded incriminating evidence that was ruled inadmissible because of due-process concerns. Experiment 2 replicated these results with less incriminating inadmissible evidence and also revealed that jurors did not accurately gauge the impact that the inadmissible evidence had on their verdicts. Theoretical and judicial policy implications are discussed."

Fifteen instrumented canals of extracted canines were divided into one control and four experimental groups of 3 teeth each. Each root was fixed in a case and surrounded with colored saline agar to measure the meter value of the Root ZX and to evaluate the extrusion of the irrigant. In control teeth, no irrigation was performed. In Groups 1 and 2, the root canal was irrigated using IAT with an aspiration needle placed 2 or 3 mm short of the apex. In Groups 3 and 4, the root canal was irrigated in a conventional manner with a washing needle placed 2 or 3 mm short of the apex. The file folder of a Root ZX was attached to the aspiration needle in Groups 1 and 2, and to a washing needle in Groups 3 and 4. Each canal was irrigated with 9 ml of 14% EDTA solution and 6 ml of 6% NaClO in experimental groups, and the meter value of the Root ZX during irrigation was recorded. After the irrigation, cleanliness of the canal was evaluated using a SEM and extrusion of NaClO by discoloration of the agar. Irrigation using IAT was more effective for removing smear layer compared to the conventional method and extrusion of the irrigant was minimized. In addition, the Root ZX measurement during IAT could monitor the extent of the irrigant in the apical canal."

An important biological property of the IGFBPs is their ability to increase the halflife of the IGFs in the blood. They are able to act as potentiators of IGFs activity on the cell proliferation. As IGFBPs bind to cell surfaces, they may act either to deliver the IGFs to those surfaces either for the activation of specific receptors or cell responses independently of receptor activation. Posttranslation modification such as phosphorylation, glycosylation and proteolysis of IGFBPs influence their affinity to IGFs. In addition, the IGFBPs may also act as inhibitors to block the activity of the IGFs by preventing cellsurface binding."

However, it remains a great chemical challenge due to its unsatisfactory activity and poor selectivity. Here, we report a successful case to greatly improve CO<sub>2</sub>-to-CO conversion on carbon black (CB) and nitrogen-doped carbon black (N-CB). By introducing fluorine, the faradaic efficiency of CO was increased from 12.8% (CB) and 50.8% (N-CB) to 93.1% (nitrogen and fluorine co-doped carbon black, N,F-CB) at -0.7 V. A partial current density of 4.19 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> remained durable for about 23 h. The superiority of N,F-CB can be attributed to its large catalytic areas and abundant N active sites inspired by fluorine doping. Specifically, the fluorine precursor of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) firstly performs as a nitrogen fixator, protecting the catalyst from more nitrogen escaping during the carbonization treatment. The number of nitrogen sites is about 4.4 times higher than it is for the N-CB. Meanwhile, PVDF as the area extender significantly improves the catalytic area; the specific surface area and the ECSA of N,F-CB are 8.7 and 6.9 times higher than that of CB. This work provides an insight into how heteroatoms can manipulate catalytic activity and selectivity through the catalytic area of carbon materials with more active sites."

To gain insight into Ostm1 function, we first investigated by sequence and biochemical analysis an immature 34-kDa type I transmembrane Ostm1 protein with a unique cytosolic tail. Mature Ostm1 is posttranslationally processed and highly N-glycosylated and has an apparent mass of \u223c60 kDa. Analysis the subcellular localization of Ostm1 showed that it is within the endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi network, and endosomes/lysosomes. By a wide protein screen under physiologic conditions, several novel cytosolic Ostm1 partners were identified and validated, for which a direct interaction with the kinesin 5B heavy chains was demonstrated. These results determined that Ostm1 is part of a cytosolic scaffolding multiprotein complex, imparting an adaptor function to Ostm1. Moreover, we uncovered a role for the Ostm1/KIF5B complex in intracellular trafficking and dispersion of cargos from the endoplasmic reticulum to late endosomal/lysosomal subcellular compartments. These Ostm1 molecular and cellular functions could elucidate all of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the wide phenotypic spectrum of Ostm1-deficient mice."

In the present study, we compared the time courses and dose-response relationships for the ability of i.c.v. injected neurotensin and JMV 449 to elicit hypothermia and analgesia (tail-flick test) in the mouse. The results show that the pseudopeptide analogue behaved as a highly potent and long-lasting neurotensin agonist in these two in vivo bioassays. The analogue should prove very useful for studying the effects of chronic neurotensin receptor stimulation in vitro and in vivo."

Here we developed and tested a new training protocol based on the reinforcement of audio-motor associations and thus supporting spatial development in visually impaired children. The study involved forty-four visually impaired children aged 6-17 years old assigned to an experimental (ABBI training) or a control (classical training) rehabilitation conditions. The experimental training group followed an intensive but entertaining rehabilitation for twelve weeks during which they performed ad-hoc developed audio-spatial exercises with the Audio Bracelet for Blind Interaction (ABBI). A battery of spatial tests administered before and after the training indicated that children significantly improved in almost all the spatial aspects considered, while the control group didn't show any improvement. These results confirm that perceptual development in the case of blindness can be enhanced with naturally associated auditory feedbacks to body movements. Therefore the early introduction of a tailored audio-motor training could potentially prevent spatial developmental delays in visually impaired children."

Additionally, HNO undergoes rapid hydrogen exchange with water in aqueous solution and this exchange process is catalyzed by both acid and base. The hydrogen exchange dynamics for the Fe(II)-bound HNO have been characterized and the obtained benchmark values, when combined with the literature data on proteins, reveal that the rate of hydrogen exchange for the Fe(II)-bound HNO in the interior of globin proteins is reduced by a factor of 10(6)."

With respect to non-invasive techniques, intramuscular electromyography has high selectivity for individual motor unit action potentials and is thus used to measure motor unit activity. Decomposition of intramuscular signals into individual motor unit action potentials consists in detection and classification, usually followed by separation of superimposed action potentials. Although intramuscular EMG signal decomposition is the primary tool for physiological investigations of motor unit properties, it is rarely applied in clinical routine, because of the need for human interaction and the difficulty in interpreting the quantitative data provided by EMG signal decomposition to support clinical decisions. The current clinical use of intramuscular EMG signals relates to the diagnosis of myopathies, of diseases of the alpha-motor neuron and of the neuromuscular junction through the analysis of the interference signal or of the shape of some motor unit action potentials, usually without a full decomposition of the signal."

Several Polish investigations have reported that environmental pollution may increase the risk of respiratory disease. Studies from Hungary and Romania have documented a dramatic increase in the proportion of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to antibiotics. In comparison, resistance to these agents amongst Polish pneumococci isolates is lower, although these pathogens and Streptococcus pyogenes have displayed increasing tetracycline resistance. 20% of Polish Haemophilus influenzae isolates and a high percentage of Moraxella catarrhalis strains exhibit ampicillin resistance. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been found to constitute 22% of Polish S. aureus strains. Two major clones of MRSA have been identified in Poland which differ in their degree of antimicrobial resistance. The pattern of antimicrobial resistance amongst Polish respiratory pathogens is undoubtedly a reflection of management policies and the use of these drugs. It is hoped that the economic and political changes taking place within Eastern Europe will provide the information and resources to establish more efficient infection control and antibiotic policy and thus delay and limit the appearance of bacterial resistance."

The abundance of benthic macrofauna and sediment concentrations of organic carbon were both influenced by a significant, albeit weak, interaction between farm size, defined as the maximum weight of fish permitted on site at any one time, and current speed. Above a farm size threshold of between 800 and 1000 t, the magnitude of effects at farms located in areas of elevated current speeds were greater than at equivalent farms located in more quiescent waters. Sediment concentrations of total organic matter were influenced by an interaction between distance and depth, indicating that wind-driven resuspension events may help reduce the accumulation of organic waste at farms located in shallow waters. The analyses presented here demonstrate that the production and subsequent fate of organic waste at fish farms is more complex than is often assumed; in isolation, current speed, water depth, and farr size are not necessarily good predictors of benthic impact."

We assessed changes in the mRNAs and proteins for NT-3 and TrkC in the lumbar spinal cord and associated soleus muscle following 3 and 7 days of voluntary wheel running. We used quantitative Taqman RT-PCR to measure mRNA and ELISA to assess protein levels. NT-3 mRNA and protein levels increased in the spinal cord to reach statistical significance after 7 days of exercise compared to sedentary control rats. Immunohistochemical analyses localized the elevated NT-3 to the substantia gelatinosa (SG) and nucleus of the dorsal horn. TrkC mRNA levels were significantly elevated in the spinal cord after 3 and 7 days of running. In the soleus muscle, NT-3 mRNA levels and its receptor TrkC were elevated after 3 days, while NT-3 protein levels remained unaffected. The results demonstrate that voluntary exercise has a differential effect on NT-3 as well as its receptor TrkC in the neural and muscular components of the neuromuscular system, and emphasize the role of voluntary activity on the spinal cord and muscle."

Within 48 h postoperatively, the patient reported neither pain nor further bleeding and her tongue presented normal function.

At least four different effects have been found to influence, in females, the phenotypic expression of genes responsible for X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). First, non-random X inactivation, due either to stochastic or genetic factors, can result in tissues in which one cell type (for example, that in which the X chromosome carrying a mutant XLMR gene is active) dominates, instead of the normal mosaic cell population expected as a result of random X inactivation. Second, skewed inactivation of the normal X in individuals carrying a deletion of part of the X chromosome has been documented in a number of mentally retarded females. Third, functional disomy of X-linked genes that are expressed inappropriately due to the absence of X inactivation has been found in mentally retarded females with structurally abnormal X chromosomes that do not contain the X inactivation center. And fourth, dose-dependent overexpression of X-linked genes that normally \"escape\" X inactivation may account for the mental and developmental delay associated with increasing numbers of otherwise inactive X chromosomes in individuals with X chromosome aneuploidy."

This approach enables (1) fine-tuning of kinetics through introduction of ordered/disordered structures, (2) a 12-fold variation in hydrolysis rates achieved by electrostatic (mis)matching of particle and enzyme charge, and (3) selection of enzymatic reaction products that are either cell-killing nanofibers or disintegrate.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) sequence demonstrated lesions more clearly than did T2-weighted MRI. Some of the lesions appeared as small ring-like foci, i.e. low-intensity spots rimmed with remarkable hyperintense signals, in the periventricular white matter and basal ganglia. A review of the literature revealed that the onset of chorea in cases of Beh\u00e7et's disease varied from the time of onset of Beh\u00e7et's disease to 31 years after onset of the disease. Psychiatric manifestations have often been associated with neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease.

Under conditions where enzyme activity is limiting, both enzymes stall and dissociate from their substrates six to nine residues, on average, from the base of a stable stem-loop structure.

The histone H5 promoter has binding sites for Sp1 (a high affinity site) and UPE-binding protein, while the 3' erythroid-specific enhancer has binding sites for Sp1 (one moderate and three weak affinity), GATA-1, and NF1. In this study we investigated whether trans-acting factors that bind to the chicken histone H5 promoter or enhancer are associated with adult chicken immature and mature erythrocyte nuclear matrices. We show that NF1, but not Sp1, GATA-1, or UPE-binding protein, is associated with the internal nuclear matrices of these erythroid cells. Further, we found that a subset of the NF1 family of proteins is bound to the mature erythrocyte nuclear matrix. These results suggest that in chicken erythrocytes NF1 may mediate an interaction between the histone H5 enhancer and the erythroid internal nuclear matrix. NF1 was also present in the internal nuclear matrices of chicken liver and trout liver. The observations of this study provide evidence that NF1 may have a role in a variety of cell types in targeting specific DNA sequences to the nuclear matrix."

Despite similar structural and biological profiles, Darmstoff analogs have not previously been examined as potential LPA mimetics. Here, we report a facile method for the synthesis of potassium salts of Darmstoff analogs. To understand the effect of stereochemistry on lysophosphatidic acid mimetic activity, synthesis of optically pure stereoisomers of selected Darmstoff analogs was achieved starting with chiral methyl glycerates. Each Darmstoff analog was evaluated for subtype-specific LPA receptor agonist/antagonist activity, PPARgamma activation, and autotaxin inhibition. From this study we identified compound 12 as a pan-antagonist and several pan-agonists for the LPA(1-3) receptors. Introduction of an aromatic ring in the lipid chain such as analog 22 produced a subtype-specific LPA(3) agonist with an EC(50) of 692 nM. Interestingly, regardless of their LPA(1/2/3) ligand properties all of the Darmstoff analogs tested activated PPARgamma. However, these compounds are weak inhibitors of autotaxin. The results indicate that Darmstoff analogs constitute a novel class of lysophosphatidic acid mimetics."

Many enzyme-encoding genes and transcription factors involved in the biosynthesis of phenolic acids have been identified, but the underlying post-translational regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the S. miltiorrhiza Kelch repeat F-box protein SmKFB5 physically interacts with three phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) isozymes and mediates their proteolytic turnover via the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway. Disturbing the expression of SmKFB5 reciprocally affected the abundance of SmPAL protein and the accumulation of phenolic acids, suggesting that SmKFB5 is a post-translational regulator responsible for the turnover of PAL and negatively controlling phenolic acids. Furthermore, we discovered that treatment of the hairy root of S. miltiorrhiza with methyl jasmonate suppressed the expression of SmKFB5 while inducing the transcription of SmPAL1 and SmPAL3. These data suggested that methyl jasmonate consolidated both transcriptional and post-translational regulation mechanisms to enhance phenolic acid biosynthesis. Taken together, our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which SmKFB5 mediates the regulation of phenolic acid biosynthesis by jasmonic acid, and suggest valuable targets for plant breeders in tailoring new cultivars."

Here we sequenced the sorghum transcriptome using Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time long-read isoform sequencing and developed a pipeline called TAPIS (Transcriptome Analysis Pipeline for Isoform Sequencing) to identify full-length splice isoforms and APA sites. Our analysis reveals transcriptome-wide full-length isoforms at an unprecedented scale with over 11,000 novel splice isoforms. Additionally, we uncover APA of \u223c11,000 expressed genes and more than 2,100 novel genes. These results greatly enhance sorghum gene annotations and aid in studying gene regulation in this important bioenergy crop.

It is believed that these pathologic changes are contributed by aberrant activation or inactivation of protein-coding proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. However, recent discoveries in microRNA (miRNA) research have reshaped our understanding of the role of non-protein-coding genes in carcinogenesis. In this regard, a remarkable number of miRNAs exhibit differential expression in colon cancer tissues. These miRNAs alter cell proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis through their interactions with intracellular signaling networks. From a clinical perspective, polymorphisms within miRNA-binding sites are associated with the risk for colon cancer, whereas miRNAs isolated from feces or blood may serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis. Altered expression of miRNA or polymorphisms in miRNA-related genes have also been shown to correlate with patient survival or treatment outcome. With further insights into miRNA dysregulation in colon cancer and the advancement of RNA delivery technology, it is anticipated that novel miRNA-based therapeutics will emerge."

A method to overcome the gas-liquid transport resistance and to increase oxygen supply is by adding hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to the fermentation system. Here we report that the H(2)O(2) not only can enhance the oxygen supply but also change the metabolism by inducing cytochrome P450, the key enzyme of a, o-oxidation. When C. tropicalis was cultivated in a 3-L bioreactor using the combination of aeration and H(2)O(2) feeding, DCA production rates increased by about 10% after a short period of decrease at the beginning. Furthermore, the experiments showed that the maximum activities of P450 could be induced at 2 mM H(2)O(2), and the inducible mechanisms are also discussed. Moreover, we suggest that alkane might be oxidized through the \"peroxide shunt pathway\" when H(2)O(2) is present. By adding H(2)O(2), the DCA yield in a 22-L bioreactor could increase by 25.3% and reach 153.9 g/L."

Although the functions of plant-specific BURP domain-containing proteins (BDP) have been determined for a few plants, their roles in the growth, development, and stress responses of most plant species, including coffee plant (Coffea arabica), are largely unknown. In this study, the function of a C. arabica BDP, designated CaBDP1, was investigated in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. The expression of CaBDP1 was highly modulated in coffee plants subjected to drought, cold, salt, or ABA. Confocal analysis of CaBDP1-GFP fusion proteins revealed that CaBDP1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. The ectopic expression of CaBDP1 in Arabidopsis resulted in delayed germination of the transgenic plants under abiotic stress and in the presence of ABA. Cotyledon greening and seedling growth of the transgenic plants were inhibited in the presence of ABA due to the upregulation of ABA signaling-related genes like ABI3, ABI4, and ABI5. Proteome analysis revealed that the levels of several proteins are modulated in CaBDP1-expressing transgenic plants. The results of this study underscore the importance of BURP domain proteins in plant responses to diverse abiotic stresses."

This is comparable or even exceeds the pre-Chernobyl levels (\u223c16 Bq (137)Cs and 22 Bq (90)Sr per m(3) as the basin-wide average values). The measurements have revealed that the Black Sea continues to receive Chernobyl radionuclides, particularly (90)Sr, by the runoff from the Dnieper River. An additional source of (90)Sr and (137)Cs was found in the area adjacent to the Kerch Strait that connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. This may be caused by the inflow of the contaminated Dnieper waters, which come to this area through the North-Crimean Canal. The long-term monitoring of (137)Cs and (90)Sr concentration in the Black Sea surface waters and in the benthic brown seaweed Cystoseira sp., in comparison with the earlier published sediment records of the radionuclides, have showed signs of a secondary radioactive contamination, which has started to increase since the late 1990's. This may be the result of the combined effect of a higher input of radionuclides from the rivers in 1995-1999 due to an increased runoff; and a slow transport of the particulate bound radionuclides from the watersheds followed by their desorption in seawater from the riverine suspended matter and remobilization from the sediments adjacent to the river mouths."

Although successful, the mechanisms for weight loss are not completely understood and it is thought that gastrointestinal hormones play a role. Several gastrointestinal hormones have been identified for their effects on appetite, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), leptin, and ghrelin. This review encompasses a literature search that included 45 primary articles and shows that there are alterations in GLP-1, PYY, leptin, and ghrelin postoperatively. GLP-1 and PYY concentrations were usually found to be higher, whereas ghrelin levels were typically lower post- Roux-en-Y gastric bypass than in individuals with obesity, those who were overweight or of normal weight, and in those who underwent procedures other than Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or who achieved weight loss by lifestyle modification. An understanding of how gastrointestinal hormones change after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass may help dietetics practitioners optimize nutrition care for this patient population. A review of the literature also highlighted some research gaps that should be taken into consideration when designing future studies."

Optimisation procedures include adjustment of the fluoroscopy equipment such as exposure factors as well as proper use of automatic brightness control and pulsed fluoroscopy. It is also important to gain the benefits of image processing and the higher sensitivity of flat panel detectors as compared to image intensifier-TV systems.Proper positioning of the patient with respect to detector and X-ray tube is of fundamental importance to image quality and radiation dose to the patient. Both image quality and radiation dose are also affected by the methodology used with parameters such as magnification factor, increased filtration, use of last-image-hold and the use of a grid.There is a direct relation between patient dose and the absorbed dose to the personnel since this is mostly due to scattered radiation from the patient. If the correct methodology and the correct radiation protection devices are used, the absorbed dose to the personnel could be minimised to acceptable levels even for those working with complex procedures.In order to have an organised review of all aspects of optimisation, it is recommendable to have an active quality system at the department. This system should define responsibilities and tasks for persons involved."

Even though the question of contamination with liquid nitrogen during ultra-rapid cooling and storage remain debatable with the use of \"open\" devices, it is important to revise the carrier system in a way, which minimizes the risk of contamination. According to the EU tissues and cells directive, it is advisable that the cooling and storage should be carried out in embryo carrier devices ensuring complete separation of the embryos from liquid nitrogen in a way, which minimizes the risk of contamination. The consequence of a reduction in the cooling rate resulting from the heat-insulating barrier of aseptic devices has to be counteracted by gradually increasing intracellular concentrations of cryoprotectants without inducing a toxic effect. We developed an aseptic vitrification method of vitrification for MII oocytes and embryos at different stage of development using the \"VitriSafe\" as \"closed\" carrier device."

For both sediments, VC mineralization was greater than DCE mineralization under all electron-accepting conditions examined. For both sediments, DCE mineralization was at least two times greater under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions. Although significant microbial mineralization of DCE was observed under anaerobic conditions, recovery of 14CO2 did not differ substantially between anaerobic treatments."

A variety of technical problems have hampered efforts to utilize this technology for identification of biomarkers.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 genotyping data of the patients from our previous study was used for the assessment of independent role of TAP genes to SSc susceptibility. Patients were stratified according to anti-topoisomerase I (anti-topo I) antibody status and clinical subsets of diffuse and limited cutaneous SSc (dcSSc and lcSSc). TAP1 and TAP2 gene polymorphisms were associated with different subsets of SSc: TAP1*A/A genotype with anti-topo I-positive dcSSc (p = 0.01, p corrected = 0.04), TAP2*A1/C genotype with anti-topo I-positive lcSSc (p < 0.05), TAP2*Bky2 and *C alleles with anti-topo I-negative dcSSc (both p < 0.05), and TAP2*B/E genotype with anti-topo I-negative lcSSc (p = 0.004). Although TAP gene associations were generally weak, some associations (TAP2*A1/C, TAP2*C, and TAP2*B/E) with different subsets of SSc were independent of HLA-DR associations, revealing even stronger associations (TAP2*A1/C and TAP2*C) among individuals not possessing the risk HLA-DR alleles. These results suggest the possible role of TAP gene polymorphisms in the genetic susceptibility to SSc."

Using this database, we computed vectors of proportions that peoples speaking various language families contributed to the gene pools of 2216 1 degree x 1 degree land-based quadrats of Europe. From these vectors we computed ethnohistorical distances as arc distances between all pairs of quadrats. We used these distances as predictors of genetic distances, which we calculated independently from 26 genetic systems. We find significant partial correlations between ethnohistorical and genetic distances when geographic distance, a common causative factor, is held constant. Ethnohistorical distances explain a significant amount of the genetic variation observed in modern populations. These results are highly robust to simulated errors in and omissions from the ethnohistorical database. Randomization tests show that the historical sequence of the movements does not affect estimates of the ethnohistory-genetics correlation, but the geographic locations of movements do. We track the development of the ethnohistory-genetics correlation through time and show it to be gradual and cumulative over the past 4200 years."

Historically, experimental Plasmodium challenge infections were applied to confirm that Anopheles mosquitoes were the malaria vector and to treat neurosyphilis in Treponema pallidum-infected patients. The lifesaving treatment with reliable parasite inoculation, monitoring, and drug cure was awarded with a Nobel Prize in 1927 and paved the way for human trials for clinical tests of candidate drugs and vaccines. Importantly, controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies are indispensable to bridge the major gap between phase I safety and phase II field trials. Here, we describe the biological basis, historical experiences, applications, and ethical considerations for CHMI studies.

These models and modeling frameworks differ in their applicability to and suitability for various water quality criteria objectives. They require varying knowledge of system processes and stressor-response relationships, data availability, and expertise of stakeholders. In addition, models can be distinguished by their ability to characterize variability and uncertainty. In this work, we review USEPA recommendations for model use in existing regulatory frameworks, technical support documents, and peer-reviewed literature. We characterize key attributes, identify knowledge gaps and opportunities for future research, and highlight where renewed USEPA guidance is needed to promote the development and use of models in numeric criteria derivation.

In the present study, using rat dispersed pancreatic acini, we examined the binding characteristics of helodermin, its action on amylase secretion, and the production of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP). Helodermin stimulated intracellular cAMP production dose dependently in a manner that was nearly identical to that of VIP. Helodermin stimulated amylase secretion dose dependently, showing an efficacy similar to that of VIP but with 100 times less potency than VIP. Adding 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine increased the potency of helodermin's action on amylase secretion but did not change the efficacy. The binding study showed that the order of binding affinity to VIP receptors was VIP = helodermin > secretin, while the order of that to secretin receptors was secretin > helodermin > VIP. These results suggest that helodermin stimulated amylase secretion from rat dispersed pancreatic acini via VIP-preferring receptors that are coupled to the production of intracellular cAMP, but a part of the postreceptor mechanism for enzyme secretion is different from that of VIP."

Based on the results of a phase II intermediate endpoint, additional patients may be enrolled into the 2 doses and control, 1 selected dose and control, or none of the 3 treatment arms at stage II. All patients including those of unselected dose (s) will be followed for the measurements of the phase III (ie, stage II) primary and secondary endpoints and incorporated in the final analysis.

A graphical testing procedure is also introduced for multiplicity adjustments to account for the 2 doses and 2 endpoints for the overall type I error rate control.

Both GAPDH and PRK activities are inhibited within the complex, but they can be fully restored by reduced thioredoxins (TRXs). We have investigated the interactions of eight different chloroplast thioredoxin isoforms (TRX f1, m1, m2, m3, m4, y1, y2, x) with GAPDH (A(4), B(4), and B(8) isoforms), PRK and CP12 (isoform 2), all from Arabidopsis thaliana. In the complex, both A(4)-GAPDH and PRK were promptly activated by TRX f1, or more slowly by TRXs m1 and m2, but all other TRXs were ineffective. Free PRK was regulated by TRX f1, m1, or m2, while B(4)- and B(8)-GAPDH were absolutely specific for TRX f1. Interestingly, reductive activation of PRK caged in the complex was much faster than reductive activation of free oxidized PRK, and activation of A(4)-GAPDH in the complex was much faster (and less demanding in terms of reducing potential) than activation of free oxidized B(4)- or B(8)-GAPDH. It is proposed that CP12-assembled supramolecular complex may represent a reservoir of inhibited enzymes ready to be released in fully active conformation following reduction and dissociation of the complex by TRXs upon the shift from dark to low light. On the contrary, autonomous redox-modulation of GAPDH (B-containing isoforms) would be more suited to conditions of very active photosynthesis."

The framework of the density functional theory was applied in a generalized gradient approximation together with the hybrid functional method. It is revealed that lithium atoms intercalate in this material in a maximum concentration of one Li atom per formula unit forming LiNb2O2F3. Moreover, octahedral positions in between the layers of Nb-O-F appear as the Li preferred occupancy resulting in a structural volume expansion of only 5%. Electronic structure evolution with the insertion of lithium displays a transformation from semi-conductor to metal when half of the lithium atoms are added. This transformation occurs due to a symmetry break induced by the transition from the +8 to +7 oxidation state of half of the Nb2 dimers. Then, after full lithiation the symmetry is recovered and the material becomes a semiconductor again with a band gap amounting to 1 eV. The evaluated average deintercalation potential reaches 1.29 V vs. Li/Li(+) with activation energy for lithium ion migration of 0.79 eV. The computed low potential of the redox reaction Nb2(8+) to Nb2(7+) includes niobium oxyfluoride in the map of possible materials for the anode application of Li-ion batteries."

The p75/AIRM1 gene is located on human chromosome 19 and encodes a novel member of the sialoadhesin family characterized by three immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains (one NH(2)-terminal V-type and two C2-type) and a classical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in the cytoplasmic portion. The highest amino acid sequence similarity has been found with the myeloid-specific CD33 molecule and the placental CD33L1 protein. Similar to other sialoadhesin molecules, p75/AIRM1 appears to mediate sialic acid-dependent ligand recognition."

The present study assessed the effect of the inducible isoform, HO-1. Wild-type astrocytes treated for 3-5 days with 3-30 microM hemoglobin sustained no loss of viability, as quantified by LDH and MTT assays. The same treatment resulted in death of 25-50% of HO-1 knockout astrocytes, and a 4-fold increase in protein oxidation. Cell injury was attenuated by transfer of the HO-1 gene, but not by bilirubin, the antioxidant heme breakdown product. Conversely, neuronal protein oxidation and cell death after hemoglobin exposure were similar in wild-type and HO-1 knockout cultures. These results suggest that HO-1 induction protects astrocytes from the oxidative toxicity of Hb, but has no effect on neuronal injury."

On the basis of calculations for different model systems (acid-acid, base-base, acid-base pairs, and cluster of three strongly interacting groups), it is demonstrated that the pK values, extracted from nonsigmoidal titration curves by fitting to a sum of Henderson-Hasselbalch equations, do not describe the ionization equilibrium correctly. The conditions for observation of irregular titration curves are derived analytically for the case of arbitrary couple of interacting ionizable groups. A possible relation between irregularly shaped titration curves and tautomerization is also illustrated. The protonation-deprotonation equilibrium of Asp76 in ribonuclease T1 is shown to be coupled to dipole reorientation of a water molecule bound at the protein-solvent interface.

For both age and the triple-negative subtype, it appears that the intrinsic biology which imparts inferior outcomes is not overcome with mastectomy; therefore, a recommendation for more extensive surgical therapy among these higher-risk groups is not warranted. For those at inherited risk, a more-aggressive surgical approach may be preferable, however; patient age, ER status, stage of the index lesion, and individual patient preferences should all be considered in the surgical decision-making process."

Eight subjects participated in 18 4-h sleep episodes to provide 4, 8, and 12 h of prior time awake before bedtimes at six different times of day in a sleep laboratory insulated from environmental disturbances. The results were analysed by ANOVAs and multiple regression techniques. Subjective sleep quality, calmness of sleep, ease of falling asleep, ability to 'sleep through', number of awakenings, and sleep latency showed a significant pattern of 'better' sleep with increasing prior time awake and with closeness to the circadian minimum (nadir) of rectal temperature (morning hours). 'Ease of awakening' in contrast, 'decreased' with increasing time awake and with closeness to the nadir/ morning hours. Multiple regression analysis showed that subjective sleep quality was predicted by subjective calmness of sleep and ease of falling asleep, among the subjective measures, and by total sleep time (TST) and slow-wave sleep (SWS - stages 3+4) among the physiological sleep measures. The subjective ease of awakening was predicted by slow-wave sleep (negatively) and the circadian maximum of rectal temperature. The results indicate that the duration of wakefulness prior to sleep and the timing of sleep determine its physiological expression, which in turn determines its subjective impression."

Finally, we reported on the use of suture anchors to secure the avulsed tendon. We recommend the early use of MRI for diagnosis and in planning treatment of suspected pectoralis major muscle ruptures."

However, whether CD146 is overexpressed in another two types of gynecological cancer, cervical cancer and endometrial cancer, remains unclear. In the present study, we showed that CD146 expression levels were higher in cells from cervical cancer and endometrial cancer compared with their corresponding normal tissues, using anti-CD146 mouse antibody AA4 (mAb AA4) and that mAb AA4 exhibited a high performance for specificity, sensitivity and positive predictive value in the detection of these two types of cancer. CD146 expression was positively and significantly correlated with the pathological subtype of cervical cancer and with the histological grade and depth of myometrial invasion in endometrial cancer. In addition, we confirmed that CD146 is present in the majority of blood vessels in cervical and endometrial cancer, suggesting that CD146 may be actively implicated in the metastasis of cervical and endometrial cancer via the vascular system. Thus, this study provides insights for further development of CD146 mAb in the detection of gynecological malignant cancer types and implies that a combined treatment strategy of anti-CD146 immunotherapy with other traditional chemo- or radiotherapy treatments may be a promising approach against cervical and endometrial cancer."

The results of the study showed a large mortality excess for infectious diseases (180 observed versus 9.5 expected), due to silicotuberculosis, and for diseases of the respiratory system (270 observed versus 33.5 expected) due to silicosis. An elevated standardized mortality ratio of 239 (70 observed versus 29.3 expected) from lung cancer was also detected. An increasing pattern was observed with time since first exposure, while the relationship with employment category and duration of exposure was less clear-cut. The lung cancer excess was also strongly associated with cigarette smoking, there being a dose-response relationship with daily cigarette consumption. The study confirms the results from other epidemiologic studies on silicotics which show this pathological condition to be associated with increased lung cancer mortality."

However, in some cases the disease can evolve to a severe form, which is commonly marked by acute liver injury followed by multi-organ failure and toxic shock-like syndrome [1-3]. Macrophages and monocytes are the major target cells for <i>Ehrlichia</i>, although this bacterium can infect other cell types such as hepatocytes and endothelial cells [4]. In this article, we discuss how macrophages polarization to M1 or M2 phenotypes dictate the severity of ehrlichiosis and the outcome of infection.

We investigated the properties of the antiporters and the participation of these systems in the detoxification of Li+ using mutants lacking one of the antiporters, or lacking both of them. Although the affinity for Li+ of the two systems was almost the same, the Vmax value for Li+ transport of the NhaA system was about 12 times larger than that of the NhaB system. Wild type cells were unable to grow in the presence of 0.7 M LiCl. Although a wild type cell and a mutant lacking the NhaB system grew in the presence of 0.6 M LiCl, a mutant lacking the NhaA system did not. This second mutant grew in the presence of 0.1 to 0.2 M LiCl. A mutant lacking both the NhaA and NhaB systems could not grow in the presence of 30 mM LiCl."

We administered the CDT to 223 healthy adults and scored it according to the method of Freedman et al. (1994). In 136 of the participants, we also measured global cognitive status with the Mini-Mental State Examination. We found that both age and level of education contributed to CDT performance. Interestingly, CDT performance was relatively consistent across the ages between 14-59 years, showing a marked decline after 60 and another decline after 70. Therefore, we concluded that CDT performance is relatively resistant to the effects of age for those below 60 years old. We present preliminary normative data for the Greek population stratified by age and level of education. Further research should include more extensive sampling of elderly participants (>60 years old) with varying levels of education, in order to establish more reliable norms for the elderly."

The results showed genotypic differences in competitiveness against weeds. In weed-free plots, grain yield varied from 6.6 to 8.9 t ha(-1) across different genotypes; it was lowest for PR-115 and highest for the hybrid H-97158. In partial weedy plots, grain yield and weed biomass at flowering varied from 3.6 to 6.7 t ha(-1) and from 174 to 419 g m(-2), respectively. In partial weedy plots, grain yield was lowest for PR-115 and highest for PR-120. Average yield loss due to weed competition ranged from 21 to 46% in different rice genotypes. The study showed that early canopy closure, high leaf area index at early stage, and high root biomass and volume correlated positively with competitiveness. This study suggests that some traits (root biomass, leaf area index, and shoot biomass at the early stage) could play an important role in conferring weed competitiveness and these traits can be explored for dry-seeded rice."

Chicken manure aqueous extract contains 10.8\u00a0ppm Cu and 0.7\u00a0ppm Ni. The level of Cu and Ni in Milorganite is lower. The current study identified an aqueous solution containing 5\u00a0ppm Cu, lower than in chicken manure aqueous extract, was highly phytotoxic to mustard seeds germination. Therefore, phytotoxicity of chicken manure is in part due to Cu. An aqueous solution containing 1\u00a0ppm Ni was not phytotoxic; whereas 0.125\u00a0ppm Ni was phytotoxic when 62.5\u00a0ppm Na, which is nontoxic, was added to the solution.

However, the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias in DM1 are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that abnormalities in the cardiac sodium current (INa) are involved, and used a transgenic mouse model reproducing the expression of triplet expansion observed in DM1 (DMSXL mouse). The injection of the class-I antiarrhythmic agent flecainide induced prominent conduction abnormalities and significantly lowered the radial tissular velocities and strain rate in DMSXL mice compared to WT. These abnormalities were more pronounced in 8-month-old mice than in 3-month-old mice. Ventricular action potentials recorded by standard glass microelectrode technique exhibited a lower maximum upstroke velocity [dV/dt](max) in DMSXL. This decreased [dV/dt](max) was associated with a 1.7 fold faster inactivation of INa in DMSXL myocytes measured by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Finally in the DMSXL mouse, no mutation in the Scn5a gene was detected and neither cardiac fibrosis nor abnormalities of expression of the sodium channel protein were observed. Therefore, alterations in the sodium current markedly contributed to electrical conduction block in DM1. This result should guide pharmaceutical and clinical research toward better therapy for the cardiac arrhythmias associated with DM1."

We have applied double-immunofluorescence using antibodies against parvalbumin --a marker for the Chandelier and basket cell subpopulation of interneurons--and to the alpha4 and alpha7 subunit proteins of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The vast majority of the parvalbuminergic interneurons was immunoreactive for the alpha4 and the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

Studies have shown that certain miRNAs are associated with resistance to chemotherapy or drug sensitization; however, the underlying mechanisms have largely remained elusive. Multiple drug resistance is a major barrier for the treatment of advanced HCC. In the present study, miR-101 was observed to be downregulated in a panel of HCC cell lines, suggesting that it has a tumor suppressor role. Furthermore, transfection of miR-101 significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin to HepG2 cells. While overexpression of miR-101 did not influence the accumulation of doxorubicin, it promoted the apoptosis-inducing effect of doxorubicin in HepG2 cells. A bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR-101 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), which was verified by a luciferase reporter assay. Finally, transfection of HepG2 cells with Mcl-1 expression plasmid inhibited apoptosis caused by doxorubicin plus miR-101 expression. In conclusion, the present study showed that miR-101 is a negative regulator of Mcl-1 in HCC, and the combination of miR-101 expression with doxorubicin may represent a novel approach for the treatment of HCC."

The neuroendocrine mechanism mainly involves the inhibition of neuroinflammatory reaction in some higher brain regions, reduction of neuronal apoptosis, and suppression of the sympathetic cardiovascular regulatory functional areas of the brain stem, regulation of neurotransmitters and autonomic balance, activation of brain areas related to BP regulation, and promotion of functional connection between brain networks. The improvement of metabolic abnormality mainly refers to amelioration of imbalance of intestinal flora and target metabolites related to hypertension. The alteration of gene expression mainly manifests as up- and down-regulation of expression of genes related to oxidative stress, inflammation and vascular endothelial function in the myocardium, hypothalamus, rostral ventrolateral medulla.

Transmission of epigenetic markers is important for some genes to maintain specific expression patterns and preserve the status quo of the cell. This article provides a review of existing research and the current state of knowledge about DNA methylation in trees in the context of global climate change, along with references to the potential of epigenome editing tools and the possibility of their use for forest tree research. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, are involved in evolutionary processes, developmental processes, and environmental interactions. Thus, the implications of epigenetics are important for adaptation and phenotypic plasticity because they provide the potential for tree conservation in forest ecosystems exposed to adverse conditions resulting from global warming and regional climate fluctuations."

Cells that have transiently expressed an inducible mutant 'sticky' flagellin are adhered to a volume of glass beads suspended in a chromatography column though which growth medium is pumped. Following repression of flagellin synthesis, newborn cells are eluted from the column in large quantities exceeding that of current baby machine techniques by approximately 10-fold. Eluted cultures of 'baby cells' are highly synchronous as determined by analysis of DNA replication, cell division and other events, over time after elution from the column. We also show that use of 'minutes after elution' as a time metric permits much greater temporal resolution among sequential chromosomal events than the commonly used metric of cell size (length). The former approach reveals the existence of transient intermediate stages that are missed by the latter approach. This finding has two important implications. First, at a practical level, the baby cell column is a particularly powerful method for temporal analysis. Second, at a conceptual level, replication-related events are more tightly linked to cell birth (i.e. cell division) than to absolute cell mass."

Furthermore, using the experiences of patients as a measure of quality was unthinkable because psychiatric patients were seen as incapable of assessing quality of psychiatric services. Over the past few years, and facilitated by Latvia's progress along the route of Western democracy and participation in international organizations (EU, OECD), as well as funding support from the EU, several policy documents have been developed with the aim of improving healthcare quality. Simultaneously, several small-scale initiatives have emerged aiming at the promotion of quality of care, such as the quality award, and the quality comparison of psychiatric hospitals. Furthermore, the Psychiatric Inpatient Patient Experience Questionnaire for on-site measurement (PIPEQ-OS) has recently been adapted for use in Latvia. The first application of PIPEQ-OS in a psychiatric hospital in Riga reveals high patient responsiveness, interest and surprise about being asked to participate in the decision-making process regarding treatment and pharmaceutical choices. More widespread use of the PIPEQ-OS has considerable potential for (1) improving information about treatment shortcomings from the patients' perspective and (2) improving the treatment process by opening doors of cooperation with patients and changing deep-rooted paradigms."

We start from a fractal structure generated by the diffusion limited cluster aggregation-deflection algorithm, onto which we then impose an interaction potential consisting of a short-range attraction as well as a long-range repulsion. After relaxing the system at zero temperature, we let it evolve at a fixed finite temperature. Depending on the temperature T we find different scenarios for the dynamics. For T approximately > 0.2 the fractal structure is unstable and breaks up into small clusters which relax to equilibrium. For T approximately < 0.2 the structure is stable and the dynamics slows down with increasing waiting time. At intermediate and low T the mean squared displacement scales as t(2/3) and we discuss several mechanisms for this anomalous time dependence. For intermediate T, the self-intermediate scattering function is given by a compressed exponential at small wave vectors and by a stretched exponential at large wave vectors. In contrast, for low T it is a stretched exponential for all wave vectors. This behavior can be traced back to a subtle interplay between elastic rearrangements, fluctuations of chainlike filaments, and heterogeneity."

Specifically, the spatial spectra distribution of a standard triangle pattern is determined. The modulation effects of the overall components of the system on a nonperiodic standard triangle pattern are analyzed and modeled. The matched filter idea is used to characterize quantitatively the spatiotemporal integration of the eye and brain to signal, aliasing, and various noise components over a triangle pattern area, and the perceived signal-to-noise ratio of the staring thermal imager is derived. Further, the TOD performance theoretical model is established. Comparison with the experimental results shows that this theoretical model gives a reasonable prediction of the TOD performance curve for staring thermal imagers. Although more tests and modifications are required, these preliminary results suggest that this model can be developed into a model that predicts the TOD for a wide range of sensors."

In type I-E and II-A CRISPR-Cas systems, this adaptation process is driven by Cas1-Cas2 complexes. Type I-F systems, however, contain a unique fusion of Cas2, with the type I effector helicase and nuclease for invader destruction, Cas3. By using biochemical, structural, and biophysical methods, we present a structural model of the 400-kDa Cas1<sub>4</sub>-Cas2-3<sub>2</sub> complex from <i>Pectobacterium atrosepticum</i> with bound protospacer substrate DNA. Two Cas1 dimers assemble on a Cas2 domain dimeric core, which is flanked by two Cas3 domains forming a groove where the protospacer binds to Cas1-Cas2. We developed a sensitive in vitro assay and demonstrated that Cas1-Cas2-3 catalyzed spacer integration into CRISPR arrays. The integrase domain of Cas1 was necessary, whereas integration was independent of the helicase or nuclease activities of Cas3. Integration required at least partially duplex protospacers with free 3'-OH groups, and leader-proximal integration was stimulated by integration host factor. In a coupled capture and integration assay, Cas1-Cas2-3 processed and integrated protospacers independent of Cas3 activity. These results provide insight into the structure of protospacer-bound type I Cas1-Cas2-3 adaptation complexes and their integration mechanism."

Recently, this model has been extended to clustered competing risks data via frailty. To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been no literature on variable selection method for such competing risks frailty models. In this paper, we propose a simple but unified procedure via a penalized h-likelihood (HL) for variable selection of fixed effects in a general class of subdistribution hazard frailty models, in which random effects may be shared or correlated. We consider three penalty functions, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and HL, in our variable selection procedure. We show that the proposed method can be easily implemented using a slight modification to existing h-likelihood estimation approaches. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed procedure using the HL penalty performs well, providing a higher probability of choosing the true model than LASSO and SCAD methods without losing prediction accuracy. The usefulness of the new method is illustrated using two actual datasets from multi-center clinical trials."

        "text": "The ultimate goal for vaccination is to stimulate protective immunological memory. Protection against infectious diseases not only relies on the magnitude of the humoral immune response, but more importantly on the quality and longevity of it. Adjuvants are critical components of most non-living vaccines. Although little attention has been given to qualitative aspects of the choice of vaccine adjuvant, emerging data demonstrate that this function may be central to vaccine efficacy. In this review we describe efforts to understand more about how adjuvants influence qualitative aspects of memory development. We describe recent advances in understanding how vaccines induce long-lived plasma and memory B cells, and focus our presentation on the germinal center reaction. As mucosal vaccination requires powerful adjuvants, we have devoted much attention to the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylating cholera toxin and the CTA1-DD adjuvants as examples of how mucosal adjuvants can influence induction of long-term memory."

The first group consisted of miners with either simple or no pneumoconiosis and was divided into two subgroups (1A and 1B). The former (1A) consisted of 62 miners most of whom had simple pneumoconiosis but a few of whom had clear films. Although their spirometry was normal, all claimed to have respiratory symptoms. The other subgroup (1B) consisted of 25 working miners with definite radiographic evidence of simple pneumoconiosis but normal spirometric findings. The second major group consisted of 25 men with complicated pneumoconiosis. In subjects with simple pneumoconiosis, static compliance was mostly in the normal range, whereas it was often reduced in subjects with the complicated disease. The coefficient of retraction was normal or reduced in most subjects except those with advanced complicated disease, in several of whom it was elevated. So far as simple pneumoconiosis was concerned, abnormalities, when present, reflected \"emphysema\" rather than fibrosis. In severe complicated pneumoconiosis, changes suggesting fibrosis tended to predominate. In the 25 working miners (subgroup 1B) dynamic compliance was measured at different respiratory rates. 17 of the subjects in this subgroup demonstrated frequency dependence of their compliance, a finding unrelated to bronchitis and suggestive of increased resistance to flow in the smallest airways."

        "text": "Enzalutamide, a second-generation small-molecule inhibitor of the androgen receptor (AR), has been approved for patients who failed with androgen deprivation therapy and have developed castration-resistant prostate cancer. More than 80% of these patients develop bone metastases. The binding of enzalutamide to the AR prevents the nuclear translocation of the receptor, thus inactivating androgen signaling. However, prostate cancer cells eventually develop resistance to enzalutamide treatment. Studies have found resistance both in patients and in laboratory models. The mechanisms of and approaches to overcoming such resistance are significant issues that need to be addressed. In this review, we focus on the major mechanisms of acquired enzalutamide resistance, including genetic mutations and splice variants of the AR, signaling pathways that bypass androgen signaling, intratumoral androgen biosynthesis by prostate tumor cells, lineage plasticity, and contributions from the tumor microenvironment. Approaches for overcoming these mechanisms to enzalutamide resistance along with the associated problems and solutions are discussed. Emerging questions, concerns, and new opportunities in studying enzalutamide resistance will be addressed as well."

Preliminary illumination of the sample is necessary to exhibit the reactivation effect of 0\u00b2 evolution.

Upon illumination of the reactivated particles with flashes of 1s duration and at a frequency of 0,1 Hz, 0\u00b2 evolution occurs according to the mechanism analogous to that in the initial parties of PS 2.

To better understand this dimorphic control of chromosome replication, we isolated replication origins (oris) from freshwater Caulobacter (FWC) and marine Caulobacter (MCS) species. Previous studies implicated integration host factor (IHF) and CcrM DNA methylation sites in replication control. However, ori IHF and CcrM sites identified in the model FWC CB15 were only conserved among closely related FWCs. DnaA boxes and CtrA binding sites are established CB15 ori components. CtrA is a two-component regulator that blocks chromosome replication selectively in CB15 swarmers. DnaA boxes and CtrA sites were found in five FWC and three MCS oris. Usually, a DnaA box and a CtrA site were paired, suggesting that CtrA binding regulates DnaA activity. We tested this hypothesis by site-directed mutagenesis of an MCS10 ori which contains only one CtrA binding site overlapping a critical DnaA box. This overlapping site is unique in the whole MCS10 genome. Selective DnaA box mutations decreased replication, while selective CtrA binding site mutations increased replication of MCS10 ori plasmids. Therefore, both FWC and MCS oris use CtrA to repress replication. Despite this similarity, phylogenetic analysis unexpectedly shows that CtrA usage evolved separately among these Caulobacter oris. We discuss consensus oris and convergent ori evolution in differentiating bacteria."

        "text": "Fungal and oomycete pathogens cause many destructive diseases of plants and important diseases of humans and other animals. Fungal and oomycete plant pathogens secrete numerous effector proteins that can enter inside host cells to condition susceptibility. Until recently it has been unknown if these effectors enter via pathogen-encoded translocons or via pathogen-independent mechanisms. Here we review recent evidence that many fungal and oomycete effectors enter via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and can do so in the absence of the pathogen. Surprisingly, a large number of these effectors utilize cell surface phosphatidyinositol-3-phosphate (PI-3-P) as a receptor, a molecule previously known only inside cells. Binding of effectors to PI-3-P appears to be mediated by the cell entry motif RXLR in oomycetes, and by diverse RXLR-like variants in fungi. PI-3-P appears to be present on the surface of animal cells also, suggesting that it may mediate entry of effectors of fungal and oomycete animal pathogens, for example, RXLR effectors found in the oomycete fish pathogen, Saprolegnia parasitica. Reagents that can block PI-3-P-mediated entry have been identified, suggesting new therapeutic strategies."

The present study examined the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling as well as the expression and activity of cell cycle proteins in FGF2-stimulated intimal smooth muscle cells. FGF2 activates ERKs 1 and 2, and Western blot analysis showed that cyclin D, cyclin E, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDKs) 2 and 4 were expressed in intimal smooth muscle cells after FGF2 infusion. FGF2 stimulation, however, did not lead to phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), CDK 2 activation, or expression of cyclin A. Western blot analysis showed that intimal smooth muscle cells express elevated levels of the cell cycle inhibitors p15(INK4b) and p27(Kip1), compared with medial smooth muscle cells, and that FGF2 stimulation does not reduce the level of these inhibitors. These studies suggest that despite activation of ERKs 1 and 2 and expression of the cell cycle activators, cyclin D and cyclin E, high levels of cell cycle inhibitors may inhibit cell cycle transit in FGF2-stimulated intimal smooth muscle cells."

A theoretical model is then developed for SGBM in dilute binary alloys, focusing on the effect of solute type and content, and applied to 10 alloy systems with remarkable agreement. SGMB does not depend on cooling rate or time but relates to grain size. It tends to occur athermally.

Pain is one of the most typical symptom in NMO. However, few studies have been conducted to examine the neuropathic pain mechanism of NMO patients or gender-specific effects using magnetic resonance imaging technique. A total of 38 female patients with NMO, 28 with pain (NMOWP) and 10 without pain (NMOWoP), were classified using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI); 22 healthy females were also recruited. We used the FSL Image Registration and Segmentation Toolbox (FIRST) for subcortical region volumes quantifications, and voxel-based morphometry analysis for cortical gray matter (GM) volume, to examine the brain morphology in NMOWP patients. In addition, correlation test between structural measurements of NMO patients and clinical indexes was also performed. The results showed: 1) no significant differences in cortical GM density between the NMOWP and NMOWoP groups; 2) significantly smaller hippocampus and pallidum volumes in the NMOWP group compared with the NMOWoP group; 3) significant negative correlation between the average BPI and volumes of the accumbens nucleus and thalamus in NMO patients.

Demonstrating secretion of a foreign gene product from Bacillus, we here report that the Escherichia coli beta-lactamase gene, devoid of its own signal sequence coding region, can be expressed in B. subtilis by the aid of the secretion vectors so that greater than 95% of the enzyme activity is secreted to the growth medium. Efficient secretion of beta-lactamase (penicillin amido-beta-lactamhydrolase, EC 3.5.2.6) is observed if the complete signal sequence coding region of the alpha-amylase gene precedes the beta-lactamase structural gene. However, an incomplete alpha-amylase signal peptide lacking the six carboxy-terminal amino acid residues does not promote secretion of the fused beta-lactamase, which remains unprocessed and cell-associated."

The increase is due to increasing amounts of beta-casein; the alpha-casein remains largely constant. The alpha-casein is the more highly phosphorylated; the most abundant form is the 10-P, throughout lactation. The level of phosphorylation of beta-casein shifts to lower average values in late lactation, possibly indicating the enzymatic reaction is overloaded by the increasing amounts of beta-casein. Unlike bovine casein micelles, the wallaby micelles are not completely disrupted at pH 7.0 by sequestration of their calcium content with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). Complete disruption only follows the addition of sodium dodecyl sulphate, indicating considerably greater importance for hydrophobic bonds in maintaining their integrity. This micellar behaviour indicates that, despite the evolutionary divergence of marsupials millennia ago, the caseins of wallaby milk assemble into micelles in much the same fashion as in bovine milk."

These longitudinal data were analyzed with a novel method, using a mathematical model to describe the observed responses, and their variation among subjects. This allowed us to estimate biologically meaningful characteristics of the serum antibody response, like peak level and decay rate, and to compare these among natural infections and vaccine responses. Compared to natural infection, responses to PT after vaccination with the tested vaccines are smaller in magnitude and tend to decay slightly faster. When present in vaccines, FHA and Prn tend to produce high peak levels, higher than those in naturally infected patients, but these decay faster. As expected, the Dutch whole cell vaccine produced lower antibody responses than the acellular vaccines. This model allows a better comparison of the kinetics of vaccine induced antibody responses and after natural infection over a long follow up period."

Tubules were obtained from the control and obstructed kidneys after 1, 2, and 4 days of obstruction. Paired comparison of function of cortical or medullary tubules and urine pH was made. Medullary collecting tubules showed decreased acidification after 2 days of obstruction (7.7 +/- 8.5 vs. 29.9 +/- 6.6 pmol/mm/min). Cortical collecting tubules from the obstructed kidney showed high rates of acidification at all time periods examined, and rates from the postobstructed cortical collecting tubules exceeded levels from control tubules at the 24-hour period while barely missing significance (p less than 0.06) at the 48- and 96-hour periods. These data are not consistent with the hypothesis that the acidification defect in the postobstructed kidney occurs in the cortical collecting tubule by a voltage-dependent mechanism."

Coefficients of friction and wear rates were measured as a function of applied load at sliding speeds of 0.2, 0.8 and 3.0 m/s. The wear mechanisms were identified in the mild and severe wear regimes by means of morphological observation and composition analysis of worn surfaces using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). Analyses of microstructure and hardness changes in subsurfaces verified the microstructure transformation from the deformed to the dynamically recrystallized, and properties changed from the strain hardening to dynamic crystallization (DRX) softening before and after the mild-severe wear transition. The mild-severe wear transition can be determined by a proposed contact surface DRX temperature criterion, from which the critical DRX temperatures at different sliding speeds are calculated using DRX dynamics; hence transition loads can also be calculated using a transition load model. The calculated transition loads are in good agreement with the measured ones, demonstrating the validity and applicability of the contact surface DRX temperature criterion."

In Dictyostelium, 7-TM cAMP receptors direct chemotaxis and development but also regulate the periodic synthesis of their own ligand, the chemoattractant/morphogen cAMP. We now demonstrate through loss-of-function/gain-of-function studies that the novel heterotrimeric Galpha9 protein subunit regulates an inhibitory pathway during early Dictyostelium development for the cAMP signal response."

It is widely accepted that the major function of NADH shuttles is to increase mitochondrial energy production. Our study tested the hypothesis that the novel major function of NADH shuttles in cancer cells is to maintain glycolysis by decreasing cytosolic NADH/NAD(+) ratios. We found that AOAA, a widely used MAS inhibitor, led to decreased intracellular ATP levels, altered cell cycle and increased apoptosis and necrosis of C6 glioma cells, without affecting the survival of primary astrocyte cultures. AOAA also decreased the glycolytic rate and the levels of extracellular lactate and pyruvate, without affecting the mitochondrial membrane potential of C6 cells. Moreover, the toxic effects of AOAA were completely prevented by pyruvate treatment. Collectively, our study has suggested that AOAA may be used to selectively decrease glioma cell survival, and the major function of MAS in cancer cells may be profoundly different from its major function in normal cells: The major function of MAS in cancer cells is to maintain glycolysis, instead of increasing mitochondrial energy metabolism."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerance and safety of a concentrated preterm formula (CPF) as a liquid human milk fortifier (HMF) for premature infants at increased risk of feeding intolerance. We prospectively enrolled preterm infants over an 18-month period, for whom a clinical decision had been made to add CPF to human milk due to concerns regarding tolerance of powder HMF. Data on feed tolerance, anthropometry, and serum biochemistry values were recorded. Serious adverse events, such as mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and sepsis, were monitored. A total of 29 babies received CPF fortified milk during the study period. The most common indication for starting CPF was previous intolerance to powder HMF. Feeding intolerance was noted in 4 infants on CPF. The growth velocity of infants was satisfactory (15.9 g/kg/day) after addition of CPF to feeds. The use of CPF as a fortifier in preterm babies considered at increased risk for feed intolerance seems well tolerated and facilitates adequate growth. Under close nutrition monitoring, this provides an additional option for human milk fortification in this challenging subgroup of preterm babies, especially in settings with limited human milk fortifier options."

        "text": "Brown fat is a thermogenic organ that allows newborns and small mammals to maintain a stable body temperature when exposed to cold. The heat generation capacity is based on the uncoupling of respiration from ATP synthesis mediated by the uncoupling protein UCP1. The first studies on the properties of these mitochondria revealed that fatty acid removal was an absolute prerequisite for respiratory control. Thus fatty acids, that are substrate for oxidation, were proposed as regulators of respiration. However, their ability to uncouple all types of mitochondria and the demonstration that several mitochondrial carriers catalyze the translocation of the fatty acid anion have made them unlikely candidates for a specific role in brown fat. Nevertheless, data strongly argue for a physiological function. First, fatty acids mimic the noradrenaline effects on adipocytes. Second, there exists a precise correlation between fatty acid sensitivity and the levels of UCP1. Finally, fatty acids increase the conductance by facilitating proton translocation, a mechanism that is distinct from the fatty acid uncoupling mediated by other mitochondrial carriers. The regulation of UCP1 and UCP2 by retinoids and the lack of effects of fatty acids on UCP2 or UCP3 are starting to set differences among the new uncoupling proteins."

While ChIP-Seq enables probing of DNA-protein interaction over the entire genome, it requires the use of sophisticated tools to recognize hidden patterns and extract meaningful data. Over the years, various attempts have resulted in several algorithms making use of different heuristics to accurately determine individual peaks corresponding to unique DNA-protein. However, finding all the significant peaks with high accuracy in a reasonable time is still a challenge. In this work, we propose the use of Multi-level thresholding algorithm, which we call LinMLTBS, used to identify the enriched regions on ChIP-Seq data. Although various suboptimal heuristics have been proposed for multi-level thresholding, we emphasize on the use of an algorithm capable of obtaining an optimal solution, while maintaining linear-time complexity. Testing various algorithm on various ENCODE project datasets shows that our approach attains higher accuracy relative to previously proposed peak finders while retaining a reasonable processing speed."

The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major risk factor in the development and progression of HCC. However, the correlation between HBV and miR-101 has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we reported that HBV could repress miR-101-3p by inhibiting its promoter activity and identified the potential effects of miR-101-3p on some important biological properties of HCC cells by targeting Rap1b. Dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that HBV down-regulated miR-101-3p by inhibiting its promoter activity. Down-regulation of miR-101-3p promoted cell proliferation, migration, and reduced apoptosis, and resulted in up-regulation of Rap1b, while overexpression of miR-101-3p inhibited these processes. Moreover, overexpression of Rap1b was able to reverse the suppressed cell proliferation and migration mediated by miR-101-3p. Our data showed that HBV down-regulated miR-101-3p expression by inhibiting its promoter activity, which resulted in up-regulation of Rap1b, and down-regulation of miR-101-3p or up-regulation of Rap1b promoted proliferation and migration of HCC cells. This provides a new understanding of the mechanism of HBV-related HCC pathogenesis and the potential application of miR-101-3p in cancer therapy."

The considered outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures were generated from systematic literature reviews. Feedback was sought from patients and health professionals. Patients with very high-risk CKD (stages G3a/A3 and G3b/A2-G5, including dialysis, kidney transplantation, and conservative care) were selected as the target population. Using an online modified Delphi process, outcomes important to all patients were selected, such as survival and hospitalization, and to treatment-specific subgroups, such as vascular access survival and kidney allograft survival. Patient-reported outcome measures were included to capture domains of health-related quality of life, which were rated as the most important outcomes by patients. Demographic and clinical variables were identified to be used as case-mix adjusters. Use of these consensus recommendations could enable institutions to monitor, compare, and improve the quality of their CKD care."

Past studies have shown that the size of expanded CAG repeat is inversely associated with age at onset (AO) of HD. It is not known whether the normal Huntington allele size influences the relation between the expanded repeat and AO of HD. Data collected from two independent cohorts were used to test the hypothesis that the unexpanded CAG repeat interacts with the expanded CAG repeat to influence AO of HD. In the New England Huntington Disease Center Without Walls (NEHD) cohort of 221 HD affected persons and in the HD-MAPS cohort of 533 HD affected persons, we found evidence supporting an interaction between the expanded and unexpanded CAG repeat sizes which influences AO of HD (P = 0.08 and 0.07, respectively). The association was statistically significant when both cohorts were combined (P = 0.012). The estimated heritability of the AO residual was 0.56 after adjustment for normal and expanded repeats and their interaction. An analysis of tertiles of repeats sizes revealed that the effect of the normal allele is seen among persons with large HD repeat sizes (47-83). These findings suggest that an increase in the size of the normal repeat may mitigate the expression of the disease among HD affected persons with large expanded CAG repeats."

The INS line corresponding to transitions between the three sub-levels comprising the ortho ground state to the non-degenerate para ground state was studied as a function of temperature down to 60 mK in neutron energy gain. The experiments show that at ambient pressure the three ortho sub-levels are split into a low energy non-degenerate level and a high energy doubly degenerate level separated by 0.135 \u00b1 0.010 meV. This observation is consistent with hydrogen molecules being located at sites with axial symmetry superseding the icosahedral symmetry of isolated rigid C60 cages in the solid phase. To gain insight into the role of inter-cage interactions in determining the symmetry breaking potential, the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the fine structure of the line was also investigated.

Duration of the recovery period affected the pattern of preconvulsive running. Furthermore, the motor asymmetries exhibited during clonus remained consistent across tests. Because duration of acoustic stimulation and attainment of clonus did not affect recovery rate, we conclude that neither the auditory fatigue nor the anoxia hypothesis provides a complete account for the refractory period after audiogenic seizure.

The adhesive behavior arises from strong solid-liquid interactions. This is a chemical reaction free adhesive (no curing time) that can be repeatedly used and is capable of instantaneously joining a large number of diverse materials (metals, ceramic, and polymer) in air and underwater. The current work is a significant advance in the development of amphibious multifunctional adhesives and presents potential applications in a range of sealing applications, including medical ones."

While the classroom offers a natural context for peer interactions, few interventions are designed specifically for classroom settings. This study investigated the effects of a classroom-teacher implemented social communication intervention, known as Social Stations, on the initiating and responding behaviors of students with autism. The study was set in an inclusive primary school, with the teacher embedding the intervention into the student's daily literacy lessons. All students with autism showed significant improvements in the targeted behaviors, with improvements maintained over time. This study suggests that social communication interventions can be implemented by teachers as part of a daily classroom program."

In the current study, we hypothesized that there is similar up-regulation of D1R in a monogamous primate, the titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus). Receptor binding of the D1R antagonist [<sup>11</sup> C]-SCH23390 was measured in male titi monkeys using PET scans before and after pairing with a female. We found that within-subject analyses of pairing show significant increases in D1R binding in the lateral septum, but not the nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, or ventral pallidum. The lateral septum is involved in a number of processes that may contribute to social behavior, including motivation, affect, reward, and reinforcement. This region also plays a role in pair bonding and paternal behavior in voles. Our observations of changes in D1R in the lateral septum, but not the nucleus accumbens, suggest that there may be broadly similar dopaminergic mechanisms underlying pair bonding across mammalian species, but that the specific changes to neural circuitry differ. This study is the first research to demonstrate neuroplasticity of the dopamine system following pair bonding in a non-human primate; however, substantial variability in the response to pairing suggests the utility of further research on the topic."

Recombinant baculovirus was used to express human Pgp in Sf9 cells and Pgp was also coexpressed with either PKC alpha or PKC epsilon. ATPase assays showed the enzyme activity of Pgp to be elevated during co-expression with the Ca2+ dependent isoform PKC alpha, but not with the Ca2+ independent variant PKC epsilon. Furthermore, neither isoform, when co-expressed with Pgp, altered the swelling-activated efflux of 125I from Sf9 cells. However, in cells co-expressing Pgp/PKC (alpha or epsilon), pre-treatment with the phorbol ester TPA significantly reduced the swelling-activated 125I efflux with both PKC isoforms. Our results suggest that phosphorylation with the Ca2+ independent variant PKC epsilon does not regulate the ATPase activity of Pgp and that stimulation of PKC with TPA alters the swelling-activated efflux of anions from insect cells expressing Pgp."

The disease is characterized by rectal bleeding and diarrhea during periods of exacerbation; these symptoms usually abate with treatment. The pathogenic mechanism of ulcerative colitis is believed to be an aberrant immune response in which antibodies are formed against colonic epithelial protein(s). The disease usually presents during the second and third decades of life, with a smaller peak after the age of 60 years. There is a genetic component to ulcerative colitis, with a higher incidence among family members and, particularly, first-degree relatives. Diagnosis depends on several factors, most notably symptoms, demonstration of uniformly inflamed mucosa beginning in the rectum, and exclusion of other causes of colitis, such as infection. There is no medical cure for ulcerative colitis, but medical therapy is effective and can improve or eliminate symptoms in more than 80% of patients. Surgery offers a cure but carries the high price of total colectomy. New surgical methods, such as ileoanal anastomosis, allow for maintenance of bowel continuity and better patient satisfaction."

The authors report the case of middle aged woman, who a few months after undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity (body mass index 49), presented with generalised fatigability and abnormal liver function. A CT scan of the abdomen was suggestive of miliary TB. The patient developed acute abdomen pain. Intraoperative findings included perforated stomal ulcers at the gastrojejunostomy, diffuse micronodular involvement of the liver and spleen and thickened omentum. The perforation was closed and liver and omental biopsies were taken. Histology results from the liver and omentum revealed necrotising granulomatous inflammation suggestive of TB. Abdominal TB is a relatively rare manifestation of extrapulmonary TB. However, this diagnosis should be considered in patients immunocompromised due to immunosuppressive medication or operations affecting their nutrition. Early diagnosis and effective treatment of abdominal TB may decrease morbidity and mortality in such patients."

Despite the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids, fracture risk rises within the first 3\u00a0months of treatment. As such, osteoporosis prevention and treatment needs to be considered in all patients started on chronic glucocorticoids (\u22653\u00a0months of treatment). For very low risk patients, conservative management with non-pharmacologic strategies may be appropriate. For the moderate to high fracture risk patients treated with glucocorticoids, pharmacologic treatment with 1 of the 4 approved medications should be considered.

Although this genus was established 130 years ago, crucial questions on the phylogenetic relationships and biology of this enigmatic taxon are still unanswered. In order to infer a robust hypothesis about the phylogenetic position of Entorrhiza and to evaluate evolutionary trends, multiple gene sequences and morphological characteristics of Entorrhiza were analyzed and compared with respective findings in Fungi. In our comprehensive five-gene analyses Entorrhiza appeared as a highly supported monophyletic lineage representing the sister group to the rest of the Dikarya, a phylogenetic placement that received but moderate maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony bootstrap support. An alternative maximum likelihood tree with the constraint that Entorrhiza forms a monophyletic group with Basidiomycota could not be rejected. According to the first phylogenetic hypothesis, the teliospore tetrads of Entorrhiza represent the prototype of the dikaryan meiosporangium. The alternative hypothesis is supported by similarities in septal pore structure, cell wall and spindle pole bodies. Based on the isolated phylogenetic position of Entorrhiza and its peculiar combination of features related to ultrastructure and reproduction mode, we propose a new phylum Entorrhizomycota, for the genus Entorrhiza, which represents an apparently widespread group of inconspicuous fungi."

Possible partial structural relationships between the two enzymes were explored by immunochemical techniques. Rabbit antisera raised against each individual lysophospholipase showed no cross-reactivity with the other enzyme. This was concluded from immuno double-diffusion experiments and from the results of immunoprecipitation of enzymatic activities in solution. 3. Lysophospholipase and esterase activity in the purified preparation of lysophospholipase II from beef liver were concomitantly precipitated by anti-serum against lysophospholipase II.

Positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), a Cdk9/cyclin T1 heterodimer, has been reported to play a critical role in transcription elongation. However, the relationship between actin and P-TEFb is still not clear. In this study, actin was found to interact with Cdk9, a catalytic subunit of P-TEFb, in elongation complexes. Using immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays, Cdk9 was found to bind to G-actin through the conserved Thr-186 in the T-loop. Overexpression and in vitro kinase assays showed that G-actin promotes P-TEFb-dependent phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain. An in vitro transcription experiment revealed that the interaction between G-actin and Cdk9 stimulated Pol II transcription elongation. ChIP and immobilized template assays indicated that actin recruited Cdk9 to a transcriptional template in vivo and in vitro. Using cytokine IL-6-inducible p21 gene expression system, we revealed that actin recruited Cdk9 to endogenous gene. Moreover, overexpression of actin and Cdk9 increased histone H3 acetylation and acetylized histone H3 binding to a transcriptional template through the interaction with histone acetyltransferase, p300. Taken together, our results suggested that actin participates in transcription elongation by recruiting Cdk9 for phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain, and the actin-Cdk9 interaction promotes chromatin remodeling."

We report a new general single thermodynamic deracemization process based on cocrystallization for the deracemization of (R,S)-4,4-dimethyl-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)pentan-3-one.

Several regimens have been examined; none of them have demonstrated a consistent increase in overall survival. The treatment of hormonally resistant prostate cancer is therefore palliative. Recent studies in Canada have taken the approach that the best way to measure disease palliation is to assess the effects of therapy on disease-related symptoms and quality of life. Studies with mitoxantrone and prednisone confirm that this regimen is well tolerated and leads to symptomatic improvement in approximately 40% of patients, with a median duration of improvement of more than 10 months. This is greater than that achieved with prednisone alone. Treatments that have greater activity against hormonally resistant disease are urgently needed, although improvements probably will be gradual and modest. While it may be appealing to intensity treatments to obtain greater efficacy, there is a real risk that the toxicity will nullify any benefits. This approach of directly measuring the ability of systemic therapies to provide palliation is an appropriate way to assess newer therapies for hormonally resistant prostate cancer."

When eosinophils were primed by the addition of 1 mumol/L PAF, subsequent addition of WEB 2086 had only a minor effect on the STZ-induced respiratory burst. These results suggest a role for PAF synthesis and PAF release in the activation of the respiratory burst by STZ. Indeed, supernatant of STZ-stimulated eosinophils was able to prime fresh eosinophils (as did PAF itself), and this effect was again inhibited by WEB 2086. This indicates that eosinophils synthesize and release PAF during STZ stimulation. Measurements of total PAF and PAF release showed that most of the PAF synthesized by eosinophils was released in the extracellular medium. This study shows that synthesis and release of PAF is important for respiratory burst activity induced in human eosinophils by STZ."

At 30&#160;<sup>o</sup>C, growth of&#160;P.&#160;verrucosum&#160;was significantly reduced under solute stress in both CO<sub>2</sub>&#160;treatments, with no growth observed at -2.8 MPa (=0.98 water activity, a<sub>w</sub>) and 1000 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, growth patterns under solute stress was slower in elevated CO<sub>2</sub>&#160;than under matric stress when compared with existing conditions. The&#160;otapksPV gene expression was increased under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>&#160;levels in matric stress treatments. There was fewer effects on the otanrpsPV biosynthetic gene. This pattern was paralleled with the production of OTA under these conditions. This suggest that&#160;P.&#160;verrucosum&#160;is able to actively grow and survive in both soil and on crop debris under three way interacting climate-related abiotic factors. This resilience suggests that they would still be able to pose an OTA contamination risk in temperate cereals post-harvest."

This relationship was investigated using Arabidopsis thaliana plants that were cultivated under different sulfur regimes and challenged by Alternaria brassicicola. Plants grown with 500 \u03bcM sulfate were significantly less infected compared to plants grown on 50 \u03bcM sulfate. Upon infection, the formation of the sulfur-containing defense compound camalexin and the gene expression of the sulfur-rich defense peptide defensin were clearly enhanced in plants grown with an optimal compared to a sufficient sulfate supply in the growth medium. Elevated levels of sulfite and O-acetylserine and cysteine biosynthetic enzymes after infection indicated a stimulation of sulfur metabolism under the higher sulfate supply. The results suggest that, in addition to pathogen-triggered activation of sulfur metabolism and sulfur-containing defense compound formation, the sulfate nutritional status is sensed to contribute to plant defense."

However, a growing body of evidences suggests that Smad7 is capable of apoptotic function. In the present study, we have demonstrated a proapoptotic function of Smad7 as a negative regulator of survival protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). The HO-1 protein level was elevated in cisplatin-resistant A549 human lung cancer cells and blockade of HO-1 activation sensitized the cells to apoptosis. Interestingly, overexpression of Smad7 decreased HO-1 gene expression and its enzymatic activity. Notably, Smad7 reduced Akt activity and infection with adenovirus expressing a constitutively active form of the Akt reversed the inhibitory effects of Smad7 to HO-1, indicating a negative action mechanism of Smad7 to Akt-HO-1-linked survival pathway. Consistently, Smad7 sensitized A549 cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and these effects were dependent on HO-1 and Akt inhibition. Based on these findings, we suggest that targeting Smad7 may be an efficient strategy for overcoming drug-resistance in cancer therapy."

Using periodic driving of electronic spin impurities in diamond, we realize different types of interactions between spins and demonstrate experimentally that the interplay of disorder, driving, and interactions leads to several qualitatively distinct regimes of thermalization. For short driving periods, the observed dynamics are well described by an effective Hamiltonian which sensitively depends on interaction details. For long driving periods, the system becomes susceptible to energy exchange with the driving field and eventually enters a universal thermalizing regime, where the dynamics can be described by interaction-induced dephasing of individual spins. Our analysis reveals important differences between thermalization of long-range Ising and other dipolar spin models."

These excitations can appear spontaneously during symmetry-breaking phase transitions. For example, in cosmological theories, cosmic strings may have formed knotted configurations influencing the Early Universe development, whereas in liquid crystals transient tangled defect lines were observed during isotropic-nematic transitions, eventually relaxing to defect-free states. Knotted and solitonic fields and defects were also obtained using optical manipulation, complex-shaped colloids, and frustrated cholesterics. Here we use confinement of nematic liquid crystal by closed surfaces with varied genus and perpendicular boundary conditions for a robust control of appearance and stability of such field excitations. Theoretical modeling and experiments reveal structure of defect lines as a function of the surface topology and material and geometric parameters, establishing a robust means of controlling solitonic, knotted, linked, and other field excitations."

Here we report the use of nanoparticle-based BaTiO<sub>3</sub> xerogels as green bodies, which provide a versatile route to ceramic materials under the minimization of organic additives with a significant reduction of the calcination temperature compared to that of conventional powder sintering. The structural changes of the xerogels are investigated during ambient drying by carefully analyzing the microstructure at different drying stages. For this purpose, the shrinkage was arrested by a supercritical drying step under full preservation of the intermediate microstructure, giving unprecedented insight into the structural changes during ambient drying of a nanoparticle-based gel. In a first step, the large macropores shrink because of capillary forces, followed by the collapse of residual mesopores until a dense xerogel is obtained. The whole process is accompanied by a volume shrinkage of 97% and a drop in surface area from 300 to 220 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. Finally, the xerogels are sintered, causing another shrinkage of up to 8% with a slight increase in the average pore and crystal sizes.

The mechanism which restricts migration of sperm bundles to a few hours each day is not understood. We demonstrate that a daily cycle of sperm release is initiated by the migration of folded apyrene sperm bundles through a cellular barrier at the testis base. These bundles have conspicuous concentrations of actin filaments at their proximal end. Inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin at aspecific time of day inhibited sperm release from the testis. Likewise, application of double-stranded actin RNA specifically inhibited sperm release. This RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) lowered the pool of actin mRNA in tissues involved in sperm release. The decline in mRNA levels resulted in the selective depletion of F-actin from the tip of apyrene sperm bundles, suggesting that this actin may be involved in the initiation of sperm release. Combined results of RNAi experiments at physiological, cellular and molecular levels identified unique cells that are critically involved in the mechanism of sperm release."

The criterion for hypertension was a systolic blood pressure of ( 140 mmHg or diastolic pressure of ( 90 mmHg, or use of medication to reduce blood pressure. The sensitivity and specificity of different cut-off points for WHR were calculated in the prediction of arterial hypertension according to sex, age, and presence of overweight, classified according to World Health Organization guidelines. The best cut-off points for WHR were 0.95 for men and 0.80 for women.

The present study used the same approach to show that a fifth factor, change in variance from pre to post, was also capable of influencing rdx. When the variance increased, rdx became positive; when the variance decreased, rdx became negative. These five factors appear to affect rdx through only two underlying mechanisms: regression to the mean and variance change.

To investigate the possibility that alterations at aspartyl or asparaginyl residues in the form of D-aspartate and/or L-isoaspartate could play a role in either the formation or stabilization of PrP-res in TSE-infected animals, we assayed for the presence of these abnormal residues in PrP-res. Protein D-aspartyl/L-isoaspartyl carboxyl methyltransferase (PIMT) was used to methylate and radiolabel altered aspartyl residues, which were detected in PrP-res, but at low levels (0.5 mole%). The scarcity of D-aspartyl and/or L-isoaspartyl groups in PrP-res suggests that this modification is unlikely to be primarily responsible for the differences between PrP-res and PrP-sen. However, it remains possible that such modifications in substoichiometric numbers of PrP molecules could help to initiate the PrP-res formation or stabilize PrP-res polymers in vivo."

This is the only mission that provides different sources of data, internal and external, which permit a precise description of the oscillator behavior using several assumptions. While the ICARE-NG instrument provided continuous measurement of the electron and the proton fluxes, the Time Transfer by Laser Link (T2L2) experiment demonstrated its ability to monitor the \"reading\" of the oscillator at a level of a few parts in 10<sup>-13</sup> with respect to a ground network of laser stations equipped with atomic clocks. From these inputs, and also environmental parameters such as the orbit, the attitude law of the platform, and the temperature of the oscillator, we have developed a complete physical model of the DORIS USO that fits the data at less than slightly below the threshold of 10<sup>-12</sup> that limits the use of the DORIS data in current space geodesy analyses. In this way, the model also makes it possible to provide an assessment of the new Jason-3 USO to radiation effects after the satellite launch in January 2016."

Cells from this cell line have been shown to enlarge and lift off the dish into dome structures over a period of 24-48 h in response to a factor in fetal bovine serum (FBS) [Fleming, 1995 J Cell Biochem in press]. When butyrate is added to monolayers, together with FBS, three- to fourfold higher numbers of differentiated structures, domes and predomes, can be counted. It had previously been shown [Holinka et al., 1986b] that estradiol induces heat stable placental alkaline phosphatase in Ishikawa cells. The addition of butyrate, on the other hand, results in a significant increase in levels of a heat labile alkaline phosphatase isozyme. The heat labile isozyme is also increased to some extent in cells stimulated to differentiate in response to FBS in the absence of butyrate. Differential inhibition by homoarginine and phenylalanine indicates that butyrate is inducing the liver-bone kidney isozyme that is found in endometrial glands in vivo."

Six impurities, including one degradation product of mirtazapine, have been separated on a BDS Hypersil (4.6 x 250 mm; particle size 5 microm) column with a mobile phase consisting of 0.3% triethylamine (pH 3.0)-acetonitrile (78:22 v/v) eluted in an isocratic mode and monitored with a photo diode array detector at 215 nm. The chromatographic behavior of all the analytes was studied under variable compositions of different solvent systems, temperatures, buffer concentrations, and pH values. The method was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, and linearity. The inter- and intra-day assay precision was found to be < 0.98% [relative standard deviation; (RSD)] and the recoveries were in the range 95.54-102.22% with RSD < 2.21%. The correlation coefficients for calibration curves for mirtazapine as well as impurities were in the range of 0.9941-0.9999. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of commercial formulations and the recoveries of mirtazapine were in the range of 99.38-100.73% with < 0.52% RSD. The method is useful not only for rapid evaluation of the purity of mirtazapine, but also for the simultaneous determination of related substances in bulk drugs and pharmaceutical formulations."

Integrating and utilizing the wide range of available data can be daunting. To support communities seeking to engage in health impact assessments, we developed the Neighborhood Potential Health Impact Score (NPHIS) methodology. We present the NPHIS method's four step process, and how this process was applied to an HIA focusing on the rebuilding of public housing following a natural disaster. We discuss developing the boundary definition, selection and definition of indicators, calculation of the NPHIS, and interpretation and utilization of the scores. Findings were validated using feedback from a community stakeholder advisory board as well as through feedback collected from focus groups of community residents. NPHIS methodology has proven to be a useful resource in better understanding the complex sources of potential health impacts facing communities, and in being an evidence-based, data-driven resource for HIA decision-makers and their stakeholders in our specific application. Other groups seeking to integrate similar data into their decision-making processes could benefit from replicating the NPHIS in their efforts."

Sediments were assayed for content of the thirteen most important chemicals of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) group and for some heavy metal ions (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn). Samples were collected in four tributary rivers (Prima Porta, Acqua Traversa, Aniene and Magliana) just before their confluence with Tiber river and at different stations along the Tiber river itself upstream and downstream the sites of confluence of the sampled tributaries. All samples were collected in July 1992. An alarming level of mutagenicity was reached in most of the tested stations, with an effect comparable to an X-rays exposure up to 0.4 Gy. Chemical analysis showed that the total amount of identified PAHs ranged from 4.5 to 625.2 ng/g of dry matrix in the different stations and the total amount of heavy metals ranged from 130 to 570 ppm. Tiber mutagenicity is likely to be mainly due to local factors such as the confluence of a small polluted tributary rather than to large scale effect due to an upstream-downstream relationship."

Preliminary analyses suggested limiting the daily total nucleated cell dose infused might decrease the incidence of these adverse effects. A policy change implemented in December 2007, limiting the total nucleated cell (TNC) dose to <1.63 \u00d7 10(9) TNC/kg/day, allowed us to assess the impact of this intervention on infusion-related safety, infusion schedules, engraftment, and costs in cohorts of patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplants (ASCTs) 2 years before (325 ASCTs in 288 patients) and 2 years after the policy change (519\u00a0ASCTs in 479 patients). The percentage of autologous transplant patients requiring multiple day infusions increased from 6% to 24%. Concurrently, the incidence of infusion-related grade 3-5 severe infusion-related adverse events (SAEs) decreased significantly, from 4% (13 of 325) prepolicy change to 0.6% (3 of 519) postpolicy change (P < .0004). Multiday infusions were not associated with increased time to neutrophil or platelet engraftment or the costs of transplantation. We conclude that limiting the daily TNC dose improved the safety of this procedure without compromising engraftment or increasing the costs of the procedure."

PAMAM dendrimer can enhance the solubility of hydrophobic drugs, and with numerous reactive groups on the surface PAMAM dendrimer can be engineered with various functional groups for specific targeting ability. However, in physiological conditions, these amine groups are toxic to cells and limit the application of PAMAM. In the recent years, polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugation has been the most widely used approach to reduce the toxicity of the active group on dendrimer surface. PEG molecules are known to be inert, non-immunogenic, and non-antigenic with a significant water solubility. PEGylated PAMAM-mediated delivery could not only overcome the limitations of dendrimer such as drug leakage, immunogenicity, hemolytic toxicity, systemic cytotoxicity but they also have the ability to enhance the solubilization of hydrophobic drugs and facilitates the potential for DNA transfection, siRNA delivery and tumor targeting. This review focuses on the recent developments on the application and influence of PEGylation on various biopharmaceutical properties of PAMAM dendrimers."

As such, the current study investigated the protective effect of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) against an NSAID-induced small intestinal injury. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: IEC-6 cells were treated with various concentrations of indomethacin with or without 5-ASA in a serum-free medium, after which an 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Dromide (MTT) assay, a cell apoptosis assay, a caspase-3 activity assay, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) activity measurement, a Western blotting for occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and a wound healing assay were conducted. <i>Results:</i> 5-ASA ameliorated indomethacin-induced cell apoptosis and an increase in the intracellular ROS content while augmenting the indomethacin-induced suppression of SOD2 activity in IEC-6 cells. Moreover, 5-ASA reversed the indomethacin-induced attenuation of occludin and ZO-1 expression and promoted faster wound healing effects in IEC-6 cells following an indomethacin-induced injury. <i>Conclusion:</i> Our results suggested that 5-ASA protects small intestinal cells against an NSAID-induced small intestinal injury by scavenging free radicals. Therefore, 5-ASA could be a potential treatment for an NSAID-induced small intestinal injury."

Liver insulin binding in rats with estradiol treatment was greater (p < 0.01) than in rats without estradiol, but was less (p < 0.05) than in controls fed the same food levels as consumed by the estradiol-treated rats. Therefore, with equal food intake, estradiol decreased liver insulin binding. Insulin binding in the dorsomedial, ventromedial, and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus was unchanged by food intake or estradiol, however.

The formation of NO has been shown to induce apoptosis and/or necrosis in mesangial cells and to protect other cells such as hepatocytes. Often, NO and O(2)(-) are simultaneously generated, which results in their diffusion-controlled interaction and, thus, redirects the signaling properties of either NO or O(2)(-). This has been proven for mesangial cells, where O(2)(-) formation attenuates NO-initiated apoptosis. As the mechanisms involved remained unclear, we studied the potential impact of the glutathione redox system and compared the results obtained with mesangial cells with those obtained with Hep G2 hepatocytes. In contrast to mesangial cells, Hep G2 cells appeared resistant to NO donors but displayed massive cell destruction following NO/O(2)(-) cogeneration. As a result, we noticed a greater increase in GSSG levels in Hep G2 cells than in mesangial cells. GSH depletion reversed the cell protection in mesangial cells and enhanced the cell damage in Hep G2 cells. NO/O(2)(-)-mediated mesangial protection is associated with an increased glutathione reductase activity and an increase in GSH. In conclusion, NO/O(2)(-) sensitivity is cell type specific and is determined by the glutathione redox system."

To understand the biological differences between VEGF-A and VEGF-E in vivo, we established transgenic mouse models. K14 (keratin-14)-promoter-driven VEGF-E transgenic mice showed a significant increase in mature blood vessels. However, K14-VEGF-A transgenic mice exhibited severe inflammation and oedema with increased angiogenesis, as well as lymphangiogenesis and lymph vessel dilatation. K14-VEGF-A transgenic mice deficient in VEGFR-1 signalling (K14-VEGF-A-tg/VEGFR-1 TK(-/-) mice) showed decreases in oedema and inflammation with less recruitment of macrophage-lineage cells, suggesting an involvement of VEGFR-1 in these adverse effects.

We proposed the novel Maximum Intensity T-Projection (MIP) Imaging method as a complementary or alternative approach for simplified diagnosis and grading of PFO. MIP Imaging represents the superimposition of all frames of an echocardiographic video onto one image. Thus, all bubbles passing from right to left atrium are represented in this single image. Diagnosis and quantification of PFO by MIP Images were compared to those obtained by standard echocardiographic methods, using the same echocardiography video loops. We applied the MIP Imaging approach to 122 echo examinations (75% of them TEE studies), performed to rule out PFOs. The average time needed to manually analyze video loops taken during bubble injection was 102\u2009\u00b1\u200952\u00a0s vs. less than 1\u00a0s using the MIP Imaging method. There was good concordance between the conventional echo method and MIP Imaging in the diagnosis and quantification of PFOs. MIP Imaging for diagnosis and quantification of PFOs was much less time consuming than the classical method and at least as accurate as the classical method. Thus MIP Imaging may be used initially as an adjunct method for PFO diagnosis and quantification and may eventually replace the classical method."

In previous years, he had been admitted several times for the same complaints but no cause had been identified. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen performed at admittance showed dilatation of the left renal pelvis. A renal scintigraphy was discussed with the mother, and she refused the injection of furosemide, because her son was allegedly allergic to furosemide: previous furosemide treatments during blood transfusions for his anaemia had always resulted in stomach-ache and vomiting, which may be attributed, however, to an acute dilatation of the renal pelvis due to the diuretic effect of furosemide. Scintigraphy without furosemide showed a significant obstruction and asymmetric renal function, so a pyeloplasty was performed after which he has been symptom-free. In patients with cyclic vomiting, an intermittent uretero-pelvic junction obstruction should be considered and can only be ruled out when ultrasound during the complaints and renal scintigraphy under adequate hydration and after furosemide are normal."

The photocatalytic water splitting activities of HCNS with spatially separated oxidation and reduction centers at their nanodomains were enhanced. The origin of the enhanced activity was attributed to the spatially separated reactive sites for the evolution of H2 and O2 and also to the unidirectional migration of the electron and hole on the Janus surfaces, thereby preventing the unwanted reverse reaction of water splitting and decreasing charge recombination."

The only other notable difference between the children in day care and those in home care was the environment in which they received care for almost 40 hours every week. Rates of infection varied also among the age groups within each center, with the highest rate within each center occurring in children 25 to 36 months old. Day care for young children is likely to be associated with high rates of infection with cytomegalovirus.

Plasma from infected individuals potently neutralized viruses pseudotyped with Gamma SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but neutralizing activity against Wuhan-Hu-1-1, Beta, Delta, or Omicron was significantly lower. Monoclonal antibodies from memory B cells also neutralized Gamma and Beta pseudoviruses more effectively than Wuhan-Hu-1. 69% and 34% of Gamma-neutralizing antibodies failed to neutralize Delta or Wuhan-Hu-1. Although Class 1 and 2 antibodies dominate the response to Wuhan-Hu-1 or Beta, 54% of antibodies elicited by Gamma infection recognized Class 3 epitopes.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, inhibition of CMV systemic movement also is induced by SA and antimycin A. These results indicate that the mechanisms underlying induced resistance to CMV in tobacco and A. thaliana are very similar. In contrast to the situation in tobacco and A. thaliana, in squash (Cucurbita pepo), SA-induced resistance to CMV results from inhibited virus accumulation in directly inoculated tissue, most likely through inhibition of cell-to-cell movement. Furthermore, neither of the AOX inducers antimycin A or KCN induced resistance to CMV in squash. Additionally, AOX inhibitors that compromise SA-induced resistance to CMV in tobacco did not inhibit SA-induced resistance to the virus in squash. The results show that different host species may use significantly different approaches to resist infection by the same virus. These findings also imply that caution is required when attempting to apply findings on plant-virus interactions from model systems to a wider range of host species."

In the first approach, we elicited judged probabilities and found that people appear to have greatly overestimated the actual risks for both product scenarios. In the second approach, we applied the psychometric paradigm to examine risk perception dimensions concerning these two specific products through factor analysis. There was a similar risk perception pattern for both products: they are seen as unknown risks and are relatively not dread risks. This pattern was also similar to what prior research found for lead paint. Further, we studied people's potential actions to deal with the recalls of these two products. Several factors were found to be significant predictors of respondents' cautious actions for both product scenarios. Policy considerations regarding product quality risks are discussed. For example, risk communicators could reframe information messages to prompt people to consider total risks packed together from different causes, even when the risk message has been initiated due to a specific recall event."

Glomerular pathology was assessed with percent glomerulosclerosis (GS), glomerular size and periglomerular fibrosis (PGF); vascular pathology with arterial wall-to-lumen ratio (WLR) and arteriolar hyalinosis and interstitial pathology with measurement of cumulative fibrosis and presence of scar. Using two-thirds of the study population as a model-development cohort, we found that biopsy features independently associated with an increased risk of graft failure were GS > or =15%, interlobular arterial WLR > or =0.5 and the presence of PGF, arteriolar hyalinosis or scar. The Maryland Aggregate Pathology Index (MAPI), was developed from these parameters and validated on the remaining one-third of the population. Five-year actuarial graft survival was 90% for kidneys with MAPI scores between 0 and 7, 63% for scores from 8 to 11 and 53% for scores from 12 to 15 (p < 0.001).

Isolation phee calls tend to have more syllables than calls produced in the home cage by the same animals, and as a result, are longer in duration. The durations of isolation call syllables are shorter than in home cage calls, and isolation calls have lower start and end frequencies, higher peak frequencies, and increased frequency range compared to phee calls produced by the same animals in their home cages.

In this report, we investigated if encapsulation of VEGF in nanoparticles could enhance angiogenesis in vivo as compared to free VEGF when incorporated into two different types of 3D matrices: Matrigel\u2122 hydrogels and PLGA scaffolds. Negatively charged nanoparticles encapsulating VEGF were obtained with a high efficiency by complex formation with dextran sulfate and coacervation by chitosan. After 2weeks, encapsulation reduced VEGF release from hydrogels from 30% to 1% and increased VEGF release from scaffolds from 20% to 30% in comparison with free VEGF. VEGF encapsulation consistently improved angiogenesis in vivo with both type of 3D matrices: up to 7.5- to 3.5-times more endothelial and red blood cells were observed, respectively, into hydrogels and scaffolds. Hence, encapsulation in nanoparticles enhanced VEGF efficiency by protection and controlled release from 3D implants. Encapsulation and incorporation of VEGF into 3D implants that, in addition to sustaining cell infiltration and organization, will stimulate blood vessel are a promising approach for tissue regeneration engineering."

        "text": "Proteins in the eye lens have negligible turnover and therefore progressively accumulate chemical modifications during aging. Carbonyls and oxidative stresses, which are intricately linked to one another, predominantly drive such modifications. Oxidative stress leads to the loss of glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate degradation; this in turn leads to the formation of highly reactive dicarbonyl compounds that react with proteins to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The formation of AGEs leads to the crosslinking and aggregation of proteins contributing to lens aging and cataract formation. To inhibit AGE formation, we developed a disulfide compound linking GSH diester and mercaptoethylguanidine, and we named it carboxitin. Bovine lens organ cultured with carboxitin showed higher levels of GSH and mercaptoethylguanidine in the lens nucleus. Carboxitin inhibited erythrulose-mediated mouse lens protein crosslinking, AGE formation and the formation of 3-deoxythreosone, a major ascorbate-derived AGE precursor in the human lens. Carboxitin inhibited the glycation-mediated increase in stiffness in organ-cultured mouse lenses measured using compressive mechanical strain. Delivery of carboxitin into the lens increases GSH levels, traps dicarbonyl compounds and inhibits AGE formation. These properties of carboxitin could be exploited to develop a therapy against the formation of AGEs and the increase in stiffness that causes presbyopia in aging lenses."

Alterations in bile acid concentrations may affect the pathogenesis of these different types of cancer. Our aim was to determine the bile acid profile in gallbladder bile from patients who underwent liver resection. Thirty-seven patients with cholangiocarcinoma, 5 with hepatocellular carcinoma, and 7 with benign biliary diseases were studied. High pressure liquid chromatography was used to analyze conjugated and unconjugated bile acids. CCA patients with low (\u2264 2 mg/dl) and high (>2 mg/dl) levels of total serum bilirubin had significantly higher total bile acid and conjugated bile acid concentrations than the benign biliary disease group. Markedly elevated levels of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid were found in CCA cases with high levels of total serum bilirubin. Concentrations of total bile acids and primary bile acid were correlated with serum cholesterol, bilirubin and ALP in CCA. Notably, correlation of the carcinoembryonic antigen, a tumor marker, was found with level of total bile acids and chenodeoxycholic acid. These findings suggest a different pattern of bile acid concentration in cancer patients compared to patients with benign biliary diseases. Thus, accumulation of certain bile acids may be involved in carcinogenesis."

Immunization of hosts with recombinant tick proteins has, in theory, the potential to interfere with tick feeding and block transmission of pathogens from the tick to the host. However, the efficacy of tick antigens has, to date, not been fully sufficient to achieve this. We have focused on 11 in silico identified genes encoding proteins potentially involved in tick iron and heme metabolism. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) expression profiling was carried out to preferentially target proteins that are up-regulated during the blood meal. RNA interference (RNAi) was then used to score the relative importance of these genes in tick physiology. Finally, we performed vaccination screens to test the suitability of these proteins as vaccine candidates. These newly identified tick antigens have the potential to improve the available anti-tick vaccines."

We have conducted a comprehensive review of published taxometric research that included 177 articles, 311 distinct findings and a combined sample of 533 377 participants. Multilevel logistic regression analyses have examined the methodological and substantive variables associated with taxonic (categorical) findings. Although 38.9% of findings were taxonic, these findings were much less frequent in more recent and methodologically stronger studies, and in those reporting comparative fit indices based on simulated comparison data. When these and other possible confounds were statistically controlled, the true prevalence of taxonic findings was estimated at 14%. The domains of normal personality, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, externalizing disorders, and personality disorders (PDs) other than schizotypal yielded little persuasive evidence of taxa. Promising but still not definitive evidence of psychological taxa was confined to the domains of schizotypy, substance use disorders and autism. This review indicates that most latent variables of interest to psychiatrists and personality and clinical psychologists are dimensional, and that many influential taxonic findings of early taxometric research are likely to be spurious."

Here we demonstrate a new technique for scalable manufacturing of freeform microstructures via strain-engineered growth of aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Offset patterning of the CNT growth catalyst is used to locally modulate the CNT growth rate. This causes the CNTs to collectively bend during growth, with exceptional uniformity over large areas. The final shape of the curved CNT microstructures can be designed via finite element modeling, and compound catalyst shapes produce microstructures with multidirectional curvature and unusual self-organized patterns. Conformal coating of the CNTs enables tuning of the mechanical properties independently from the microstructure geometry, representing a versatile principle for design and manufacturing of complex microstructured surfaces."

Although skeletal muscle weakness is evident after prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV), few studies have tested the benefits of various types of mobility interventions in this population. The purpose of this article is to review the published research on improving mobility outcomes in patients undergoing PMV. For this review, published studies were retrieved from MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from January 1990 to July 2007. A total of 10 relevant articles were selected that examined the effect of whole body physical therapy, electrical stimulation (ES), arm exercise, and inspiratory muscle training (IMT). Overall, there is support for the ability of mobility interventions to improve outcomes in patients on PMV but limited evidence of how to best accomplish this goal. Generating more data from multicenter studies and randomized controlled trials is recommended."

As an important component of this niche, oxygen tension has been known to play a critical role in the maintenance of stem cell characteristics. However, the effect of O2 tension on their functional properties has not been well determined. In this study, we investigated the effects of O2 tension on ASCs stemness, differentiation and proliferation ability. Human ASCs were cultured under normoxia (21% O2) and hypoxia (2% O2). We found that hypoxia increased ASC stemness marker expression and proliferation rate without altering their morphology and surface markers. Low oxygen tension further enhances the chondrogenic differentiation ability, but reduces both adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential. These results might be correlated with the increased expression of HIF-1\u03b1 under hypoxia. Taken together, we suggest that growing ASCs under 2% O2 tension may be important in expanding ASCs effectively while maintaining their functional properties for clinical therapy, particularly for the treatment of cartilage defects."

The La Reunion-associated sub-lineage of chikungunya (with a valine substitution in the envelope protein) was shown to increase viral fitness in the secondary vector, Ae. albopictus. Subsequently, a majority of experimental and modeling efforts focused on this combination of a sub-lineage of the East-Central-South African genotype (ECSA-V)-Ae. albopictus, despite the Asian genotype being the etiologic agent of recent chikungunya outbreaks world-wide. We explore a collection of data to investigate relative transmission efficiencies of the three major genotypes/sub-lineages of chikungunya and found difference in the extrinsic incubation periods to be largely overstated. However, there is strong evidence supporting the role of Ae. albopictus in the expansion of chikungunya that our R0 calculations cannot attribute to fitness increases in one vector over another. This suggests other ecological factors associated with the Ae. albopictus-ECSA-V cycle may drive transmission intensity differences. With the apparent bias in literature, however, we are less prepared to evaluate transmission where Ae. aegypti plays a significant role. Holistic investigations of CHIKV transmission cycle(s) will allow for more complete assessment of transmission risk in areas affected by either or both competent vectors."

        "text": "A methodology is described for analysing the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) in terms of molecular conformations. Molecular species that have more than a single occurrence across the complete CSD are identified, either as the sole crystal component or co-crystallized with other components. Cluster analysis, based on a root-mean-square fit of coordinates and chemical connectivity, is performed to identify conformational variance for each molecule. Results are analysed in terms of the number of discrete conformations observed versus the number of crystal environments and number of acyclic torsion angles in the molecule. Special subsets of environments are also analysed, namely polymorphs, co-crystals and solvates. In general, conformational diversity increases with an increasing number of different crystal environments and with an increasing number of flexible torsion angles. Overall, molecules with one or more acyclic flexible torsion angle are observed to exist in more than one conformation in ca 40% of cases. There is evidence that solvated molecules exhibit more conformational flexibility on average, compared with polymorphs and co-crystals."

These differences have been hypothesised to originate from genetic and environmental factors although the extent of their effect remains unclear. Effects of these factors on brain activity during action recognition were evaluated by comparing magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals in twins. MEG signals of 20 pairs of elderly monozygotic twins and 11 pairs of elderly dizygotic twins were recorded while they observed finger movements and copied them. Beamformer and group statistical analyses were performed to evaluate spatiotemporal differences in cortical activities. Significant event-related desynchronisation (ERD) of the \u03b2 band (13-25\u2009Hz) at the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) was observed for both action observation and execution. Moreover, \u03b2-band ERD at the left IPL during action observation was significantly better correlated among monozygotic twins compared to unrelated pairs (Z-test, p\u2009=\u20090.027). \u03b2-band ERD heritability at the left IPL was 67% in an ACE model. These results demonstrate that \u03b2-band ERD at the IPL, which is commonly observed during action recognition and execution, is affected by genetic rather than environmental factors. The effect of genetic factors on the cortical activity of action recognition may depend on anatomical location and frequency characteristics."

This is particularly true for scavenging species, which collect hazardous food such as dead insects. Foragers limit sanitary risks by not retrieving highly infectious prey releasing entomopathogenic fungal spores. This study investigates whether similar prophylactic strategies are also developed for food associated with weak or delayed risks of fungal contamination. We compared, in <i>Myrmica rubra</i> ant colonies, the retrieval dynamics of dead flies that were (1) conidia-free, (2) covered with a low amount of <i>Metarhizium brunneum</i> entomopathogenic conidia or (3) recently fungus-killed but not yet sporulating. Foragers mostly avoided fungus-killed prey and delayed the retrieval of conidia-covered flies. A second sanitary filter occurred inside the nest through a careful inspection of the retrieved prey. Ultimately, ants mostly consumed conidia-free and conidia-covered flies, but they relocated and discarded all fungus-killed prey outside of the nest. Our study confirms that, as a host of generalist entomopathogenic fungi, <i>Myrmica rubra</i> ants have developed a prophylactic avoidance and a differential management of prey depending on their infectious potential. We discuss the functional value as well as the possible cues underlying pathogen avoidance and prey discrimination in ants."

There are three classes of PI3Ks: class I PI3Ks produce PIP3 at plasma membrane level. Although D. melanogaster and C. elegans have only one form of class I PI3K, vertebrates have four class I PI3Ks called isoforms despite being encoded by four different genes. Hence, duplication of these genes coincides with the acquisition of coordinated multi-organ development. Of the class I PI3Ks, PI3K\u03b1 and PI3K\u03b2, encoded by PIK3CA and PIK3CB, are ubiquitously expressed. They present similar putative protein domains and share PI(4,5)P2 lipid substrate specificity. Fifteen years after publication of their first isoform-selective pharmacological inhibitors and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) that mimic their complete and specific pharmacological inhibition, we review the knowledge gathered in relation to the redundant and selective roles of PI3K\u03b1 and PI3K\u03b2. Recent data suggest that, further to their redundancy, they cooperate for the integration of organ-specific and context-specific signal cues, to orchestrate organ development, physiology, and disease. This knowledge reinforces the importance of isoform-selective inhibitors in clinical settings."

In field studies of white muscle disease (WMD) and hepatic necrosis in selenium-deficient pigs dying suddenly, veterinarians identified gastric ulcers in 40% of inspected piglets. The lesion was also commonly observed by researchers in experimentally produced vitamin E-selenium deficiency and other researchers suspected that gastric ulcers in swine may be associated with vitamin E-selenium deficiency. Mice preferentially concentrated (75)selenium in peritoneal exudative cells (PEC) when (75)selenium as selenium selenate was administered by stomach tube to selenium-deficient mice. Selenium concentrated in PECs as glutathione peroxidase (GSHP(x)). GSHP(x)-deficient leucocytes in peritoneal exudate failed to kill yeast cells. GSHP(x) deficiency has also been associated with decreased microbicidal activity of leucocytes in patients with chronic granulomatosis. The selenium-deficient swine were usually growing rapidly in crowded conditions, and, apart from WMD and hepatic necrosis, edema was prominent in the spiral colon, subcutaneous tissues, lungs and submucosa of the stomach. The elevated immunological response in the spleen and lungs of SIDS victims suggests an initial defective microbicidal propensity of the peritoneal exudative cells."

Numerous studies have reported that stress hormone treatment or <i>in vivo</i> stress exposure can enhance the growth of tumor cell lines <i>in vitro</i>, as well as tumors in animal models, and have begun to explore molecular mechanisms. Comparatively little research has focused on the impact of psychological stress and stress hormones on cancer <i>initiation</i>, in part due to inherent methodological challenges, but also because potential underlying biological mechanisms have remained obscure. In this review, we present a testable theoretical model of pathways by which stress may result in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. This model supports our overarching hypothesis that psychological stress, acting through increased levels of catecholamines and/or cortisol, can increase DNA damage and/or reduce repair mechanisms, resulting in increased risk of DNA mutations leading to carcinogenesis. A better understanding of molecular pathways by which psychological stress can increase the risk of cancer initiation would open new avenues of translational research, bringing together psychologists, neuroscientists, and molecular biologists, potentially resulting in the development of novel approaches for cancer risk reduction at the population level."

Our results indicate that kin proximity outside the household was positively associated with fertility, child survival, and net reproduction, and suggest that declining kin availability was an important contributing factor to the fertility transition in the United States. We also find important differences between maternal and paternal kin inside the household-including higher fertility among women residing with their mother-in-law than among those residing with their mother-that support hypotheses related to the contrasting motivations and concerns of parents and parents-in-law."

Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain KJ1R5(T) was most closely related to members of the genus Chryseobacterium, and that the strain exhibited the highest similarities with type strains of Chryseobacterium vrystaatense (97.0 %) and Chryseobacterium rhizosphaerae (97.1 %).

In animals, the most prominent prion diseases are scrapie of sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) of cattle and chronic wasting disease (CWD) of deer and elk. A critical event in prion diseases is the accumulation in the central nervous system (CNS) of the abnormally folded PrP(Sc) protein that is the protease-resistant isoform of a normal cellular protein encoded by the host and called PrP(C). PrP(Sc) (also known as rPrP(Sc) or PrP27-30) represents the main marker of prion diseases and is routinely used in the reference method for the diagnosis of prion diseases. Most of the therapeutic strategies developed so far aimed at identifying compounds that diminish the levels of PrP(Sc), with variable success when tested in vivo. In this review, we present an alternative approach in which small molecules that induce PrP(Sc) oligomers are identified. By using virtual and cellular screenings, we found several thienyl pyrimidine compounds that trigger PrP(Sc) oligomerization and trap prion infectivity."

Incubation of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) for as short as 5 min with NaF (40 mM) resulted in a 60% increase in PGHS activity. PGHS activity induced by NaF was unaffected by either 10 microM cycloheximide or 1 microM actinomycin D. Aspirin (25 microM) completely inhibited resting PGHS activity, and NaF did not induce further stimulation. NS-398 (500 nM), a specific PGHS-2 inhibitor, was ineffective. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) induced a significant increase in PGHS activity within 30 min and was insensitive to cycloheximide. The levels of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 proteins, as measured by Western blots, were not affected by NaF or bFGF. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein attenuated PGHS activity that was induced by NaF and bFGF, whereas the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, augmented these responses. The G protein activators 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) inhibited both resting and NaF-induced PGHS activities. These results suggest-that, in BAEC, PGHS-1 activity can be regulated by tyrosine kinase and/or G proteins, independently of de novo protein synthesis."

Isolation of S. ictaluri from moribund and dead catfish was confirmed by the newly established BIOLOG profile (MicroLog3 system). The results indicate that channel catfish were only susceptible to high concentrations of S. ictaluri and that juvenile channel catfish were less susceptible, possibly explaining why little mortality has been attributed to S. ictaluri infection in catfish aquaculture."

Both additive and minimum line-of-sight remapping are used to reconstruct the in-focus particles from the refocused image stacks. The structural similarity between the images projected by the reconstructed particle field and the images captured by the cameras are used to determine the reconstruction quality. This method was verified by both synthetic simulation and an experimental implementation. The performance of the proposed technique was compared with existing methods. The proposed method has the best reconstruction quality and computational speed among the considered methods."

A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov. RCTs using CGM in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were then selected. Statistical analysis included calculation of the standardized mean difference (SMD) or risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random effects model. After literature search, seven RCTs (669 patients) satisfied the eligibility criteria established herein and were included into the meta-analysis. Compared with the self-monitoring blood glucose group, the CGM group exhibited significantly lower HbA1c levels (SMD, -0.35; 95% CI, -0.59--0.10; <i>P</i> = 0.006) and shorter time spent with hypoglycaemia (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.70--0.13; <i>P</i> = 0.004). Conversely, no differences in body weight and blood pressure were observed between the groups. CGM in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus could reduce HbA1c levels and time spent with hypoglycaemia. However, because few RCTs were included in this present study and heterogeneity was also noted, care should be taken when interpreting the results."

Recently, six p53 immunohistochemical (IHC) patterns have been defined, which have shown strong correlation with <i>TP53</i> mutation status. However, few studies have applied this new six-pattern framework and none of them exhaustively compared p53 IHC positivity and patterns between invasive VSCC and adjacent skin lesion. We performed p53 IHC in a series of 779 HPV-independent VSCC with adjacent skin and evaluated the IHC slides following the newly described classification. Some 74.1% invasive VSCC showed abnormal p53 IHC staining. A skin lesion was identified in 450 cases (57.8%), including 254 intraepithelial precursors and 196 inflammatory/reactive lesions. Two hundred and ten of 450 (47%) VSCC with associated skin lesions showed an abnormal p53 IHC stain, with an identical staining pattern between the VSCC and the adjacent skin lesion in 80% of the cases. A total of 144/450 (32%) VSCC showed wild-type p53 IHC both in the invasive VSCC and adjacent skin lesion. Finally, 96/450 (21%) VSCC showed p53 IHC abnormal staining in the invasive VSCC but a wild-type p53 staining in the skin lesion. Most of the discordant cases (70/96; 73%) showed adjacent inflammatory lesions. In conclusion, the p53 IHC staining and pattern are usually identical in the VSCC and the intraepithelial precursor."

Complex infections with multiple genetic variants of B. burgdorferi occur in mice through multiple exposures to infected ticks or through exposure to ticks infected with multiple variants of B. burgdorferi. Using a combination of cloning and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), B. burgdorferi ospC variation was assessed in serial samples collected from individual P. leucopus during a single transmission season. In individuals with ospC variation, at least seven ospC variants were recognized at each time point. One to four of these variants predominated at each time point; however, the predominant variants seldom remained consistent in an individual mouse throughout the entire sampling period. These results confirmed that mice in southern Maryland were persistently infected with multiple variants of B. burgdorferi throughout the transmission season. However, the presence of multiple ospC variants and the fluctuations in the frequency of these variants indicates that either new ospC variants are regularly introduced to this mouse population and predominate while the existing infections are cleared, or that the variation detected in the genetic profile at different time points reflects a complex mixture of B. burgdorferi populations whose relative frequencies may continually change."

Accumulation of isoprenoid metabolites after bisphosphonate treatment allows V\u03b32V\u03b42 T cells to recognize and kill tumors independently of their MHC expression or burden of non-synonymous mutations. Clinical trials with more than 400 patients show that adoptive immunotherapy with V\u03b32V\u03b42\u00a0T cells has few side effects but has resulted in only a few partial and complete remissions. Here, we have tested V\u03b32V\u03b42\u00a0T cells for expression of inhibitory receptors and determined whether adding PD-1 checkpoint blockade to adoptively transferred V\u03b32V\u03b42\u00a0T cells enhances immunity to human PC-3 prostate tumors in an NSG mouse model. We find that V\u03b32V\u03b42 T cells express PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and TIM-3 inhibitory receptors during the 14-day ex vivo expansion period, and PD-1, LAG-3, and TIM-3 upon subsequent stimulation by pamidronate-treated tumor cells. Expression of PD-L1 on PC-3 prostate cancer cells was increased by co-culture with activated V\u03b32V\u03b42\u00a0T cells. Importantly, anti-PD-1 mAb treatment enhanced V\u03b32V\u03b42\u00a0T cell immunity to PC-3 tumors in immunodeficient NSG mice, reducing tumor volume nearly to zero after 5\u00a0weeks. These results demonstrate that PD-1 checkpoint blockade can enhance the effectiveness of adoptive immunotherapy with human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in treating prostate tumors in a preclinical model."

There were ten women and four men, with a mean age of 35 years (8 to 69). At a mean follow-up of 25 months (10 to 89), two patients had a fracture of the allograft. In one of these it was revised with a similar ARC and in the other with an intercalary prosthesis. A further patient had an infection and a fracture of the allograft that was revised with a megaprosthesis. In all patients with an ARC, healing of the ARC-host bone interface was observed. One patient had failure of the locking mechanism of the total elbow replacement. The mean post-operative Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score for the upper extremity was 77% (46.7% to 86.7%), which represents good and excellent results; one patient had a poor result (46.7%). In the short term ARC effectively relieves pain and restores shoulder function in patients with wide resection of the proximal humerus. Fracture and infection remain significant complications."

Radiosurgery is one of several commonly acceptable methods of IVS treatment, but some risk may still exist with that treatment. The aim of this study is to analyze the clinical outcomes in tumor control and hearing preservation after radiosurgery of IVS. The retrospective analysis included 14 scientific papers available in the PubMed database. Assessment of tumor volume was performed based on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted scans. Hearing preservation was assessed using the Gardner-Robertson classification (GR class). Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27. It was revealed that tumor growth control in IVS treated with radiosurgery was higher than in the wait-and-see strategy. The hearing preservation was similar in patients after wait and see and the surgical group. Radiosurgery was associated with low risk of facial nerve dysfunction."

The absorption of UVA irradiation in endogenous chromophores frequently leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)). (1)O(2) is an important biochemical intermediate in multiple biological processes. Beside other procedures, the direct detection of (1)O(2) by its luminescence is a powerful tool that helps to understand the generation of (1)O(2) during UVA exposure in solution, in vitro and in vivo. This article describes the endogenous photosensitizers, their ability to generate (1)O(2) under UVA irradiation, and the detection technology to visualize the action of (1)O(2)."

The results indicate that activation of BMMC by either thrombin or IgE-antigen is Ca2+-dependent. One million BMMC, activated by 0.05-5 U thrombin, accumulated 45Ca2+ in a concentration-dependent manner, which levelled off at around 1 U thrombin. Extracellular 45Ca2+ uptake of thrombin-stimulated cells is saturable within 90 seconds and corresponds to the kinetics of histamine release, whereas that of IgE-antigen exposed cells continues unabated for over 5 min. The pattern of 45Ca2+ uptake of IgE-sensitized BMMC exposed to thrombin suggests that the pro-stimulatory locus of thrombin action on the surface membrane is distinct from that of IgE."

For a wide range of window lengths (1/16-2048 ms), two hybrid signals were obtained by a cross-wise combination of the magnitude and phase spectra of speech and white noise. Speech intelligibility data showed the significance of the phase spectrum for longer windows (>256 ms) and for very short windows (<4 ms), and that of the magnitude spectrum for medium-range window lengths. The hybrid signals used in the intelligibility test were analyzed in terms of the preservation of the original narrow-band speech envelopes. Correlations between the narrow-band envelopes of the original speech and the hybrid signals show a similar pattern as a function of window length. This result illustrates the importance of the preservation of narrow-band envelopes for speech intelligibility. The observed significance of the phase spectrum in recovering the narrow-band envelopes for the long term windows and for the very short term windows is discussed."

The primary objective of this study was to determine the concentrations of hazardous metal pollutants associated with the aqueous and suspended solid phases during wet weather flow. A calculation of the mass of the pollutants for each storm was conducted. Other objectives of this study were to evaluate during a storm event the relationships between (1) soluble and sorbed metals, (2) storm flow and pollutant loading, including a determination if a first flush was present, and (3) total mass loading of pollutants and relative pollution loading from three watershed sub-basins. This study focused on the urbanized watershed of Ballona Creek, which is approximately 330 km2 (127 miles2) in size and developed primarily with residential and light commercial industries. In the 1997-98 rain season, an El Ni\u00f1o year, two storm events were monitored by the collection of hourly grab samples. An initial storm monitored Ballona creek, while a second storm also monitored Ballona Creek along with two smaller sub-watersheds, Centinela Channel and Sepulveda Channel. The results indicated the suspended solids phase primarily transported the mass for five of the six hazardous metals studied: cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, and nickel. Arsenic was found primarily in the aqueous phase."

At these sites, bilateral injections of 200 ng of morphine also produced a significant enhancement whereas a dose of 50 ng was below threshold for the rate increasing effect. The enhancement by morphine was effectively antagonized by naloxone (5 mg/kg). When injected bilaterally into the same area, D-Ala2-Met5-enkephalinamide (2 x 1 microgram) also induced a strong enhancement of self-stimulation lasting for 70 minutes. A possible dopaminergic substrate for the opiate induced behavioral stimulation is discussed."
