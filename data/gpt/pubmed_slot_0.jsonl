The in vivo manipulation of these activating and deactivating systems prior to S-9 preparation is possible with animals, but not with humans. Hence, the possibility of depleting glutathione in target cells and S-9 fractions was evaluated using phorone, a known glutathione-depleting agent. 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblast-like cells and V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts were used as the target cells, and cytotoxicity was assessed by the FRAME (Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments) kenacid blue method. Phorone was found to have a moderate intrinsic cytotoxicity and to effectively deplete cellular glutathione. When phorone was used in the two-component S-9 fraction/target cell system, its toxicity to 3T3-L1 cells was markedly increased, which suggests transformation to a toxic metabolite. The use of S-9 fractions from animals pretreated with phenobarbitone and beta-naphthoflavone resulted in greatly increased phorone toxicity, which indicates the involvement of cytochrome P-450 enzymes in its metabolism. The metabolism-mediated toxicity of phorone was reduced by the addition of exogenous glutathione.'", "output": "{\n  \"paraphrase_corpus\": \"Employing S-9 liver fractions to study cytotoxicity driven by metabolism in vitro introduces a challenge because it not only incorporates systems that activate but also those that deactivate, including pathways like glutathione involvement. The manipulation of these activation and deactivation systems in vivo can be done with animals but is not feasible with humans. Consequently, the effectiveness of using phorone, a compound known for its ability to reduce glutathione levels, was assessed on target cells and S-9 fractions. The cells chosen for study were 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblast-like cells and V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, with the FRAME (Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments) kenacid blue method being utilized to measure cytotoxicity. Phorone demonstrated a moderate level of inherent cytotoxicity and was successful in depleting cellular glutathione. In the combined system of S-9 fraction and target cell, the use of phorone significantly increased its toxic effects on 3T3-L1 cells, hinting at the conversion to a toxic metabolite. Enhancing the toxicity of phorone was observed when S-9 fractions from animals treated with phenobarbitone and beta-naphthoflavone were used, suggesting that cytochrome P-450 enzymes play a role in phorone's metabolism.

It is a rare but well-known manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia. Pediatrics testicular MS may pose a possible diagnostic challenge, an issue that is underscored in the few testicular pediatric MS cases reported in the literature. Herein, we report a series of 5 cases of pediatric testicular MS that are evaluated at the morphologic and immunohistochemical levels with correlation with the KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement status. Three patients presented with no prior history of acute myeloid leukemia. All 5 cases showed monoblastic morphology; positive for CD33, CD43, CD68, CD163, CD4 (dim), and lysozyme; and negative for CD10, CD34, CD117, and myeloperoxidase. KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement was detected in 4 of the 5 cases. In the literature, 8 more cases of pediatric testicular lymphoma were reported. Most of them showed monocytic differentiation and KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement was reported in 3 of the cases. In conclusions, testicular MS in pediatric patients shows monoblastic differentiation which may be attributed to the KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement. We also highlight the importance of using an extended immunohistochemistry panel in the diagnosis of MS.'", "output": "{\n  \"paraphrase_corpus\": \"Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is identified as a tumor outside the bone marrow, consisting of immature myeloid cells, and is a rare but recognized sign of acute myeloid leukemia, especially challenging to diagnose in pediatric patients with testicular involvement.
