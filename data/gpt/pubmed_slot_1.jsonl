This sequence is required for nuclear localization of Cln3p and is sufficient to confer nuclear localization to green fluorescent protein in a RAN-dependent manner. Mislocalized Cln3p, lacking the NLS, is much less active in genetic assays specific for Cln3p, but more active in assays normally specific for Cln2p, consistent with the idea that Cln3p localization explains a significant part of Clnp functional specificity.'", "output": "{\"paraphrase_corpus\": \"In budding yeast, different G(1) cyclins bestow distinct functionalities upon the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28p. The Cln3p G(1) cyclin predominantly resides in the nucleus, whereas Cln2p is mainly found in the cytoplasm. The processes of binding to Cdc28p and Cdc28p-mediated phosphorylation at the C-terminal of Cln2p are both essential for Cln2p's efficient removal from the nucleus, indicating that this mechanism might be under physiological regulation. The build-up of less phosphorylated Cln2 in the nucleus is an energy-requiring process, which apparently does not involve the RAN GTPase. In small, newly formed cells separated by elutriation, phosphorylation of Cln2p is less efficient, and this reduction in phosphorylation is associated with a decreased movement of Cln2p out of the nucleus in these newborn cells. Therefore, Cln2p appears to spend a short time in the nucleus at the beginning of the cell cycle. However, the nuclear presence of Cln3p is not affected by Cdk activity. The nuclear location of Cln3p is dependent on a two-part nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the protein's C-terminal, which is necessary for Cln3p's nuclear presence and can also direct green fluorescent protein to the nucleus in a RAN-dependent way. Mislocated Cln3p, missing the NLS, reveals reduced effectiveness in genetic tests designed for Cln3p but displays increased activity in tests usually specific for Cln2p.

While overexpression of miR-101 did not influence the accumulation of doxorubicin, it promoted the apoptosis-inducing effect of doxorubicin in HepG2 cells. A bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR-101 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), which was verified by a luciferase reporter assay. Finally, transfection of HepG2 cells with Mcl-1 expression plasmid inhibited apoptosis caused by doxorubicin plus miR-101 expression.

Several aberrant ratios observed suggest Mendelian inheritance of an autosomal recessive gene (F,f), epistatic to the major sex-determining gene (W,Z). Sex ratios of triploids and gynogens support the hypothesis of recombination between the centromere and the major sex-determining locus. Progeny testing of a female mitogyne demonstrated the viability of a novel WW \"superfemale\", which gave only female offspring. Not all data could be explained by a two-factor model of sex determination. Further exceptional sex ratios may be accounted for by rare autosomal or environmental sex-modifying factors.

Crossing O. aureus with O. mossambicus, O. spilums, and O. niloticus led to widely differing sex ratios, indicating a complex nature of sex determination in these hybrids. The data from these hybrids offered limited insights into the sex determination process within the species. Sex ratios derived from the offspring of sex-reversed males (1:3) and the majority of sex-reversed females (1:0) indicated that female heterogamety might be present in O. aureus. The presence of some unusual ratios hinted at the Mendelian inheritance of a recessive autosomal gene (F,f) that interacts epistatically with a principal sex-determining gene (W,Z). The sex ratios in triploids and gynogens lent support to the theory that recombination occurs between the centromere and the primary sex-determining site. Testing the progeny of a mitogyne female revealed the successful production of a WW 'superfemale', capable of producing solely female descendants. Not all findings could be accounted for by a simple two-gene model of sex determination, suggesting that exceptional sex ratios might result from uncommon autosomal or environmental factors influencing sex.

Comparable mRNA expression was observed in murine small and large IECs (S-IECs and L-IECs). However, Tollip protein was only detected in L-IECs, but not in S-IECs. Similar results were obtained in germ-free mice, indicating that L-IEC-specific TOLLIP expression does not depend on bacterial colonization. Next, to understand the mechanisms underlying the post-transcriptional repression of Tollip, 3´-UTR-mediated translational regulation was evaluated. The region +1876/+2398 was responsible for the repression of Tollip expression. This region included the target sequence of miR-31. The inhibition of miR-31 restored the 3´-UTR-meditaed translational repression. In addition, miR-31 expression was significantly higher in S-IECs than in L-IECs, suggesting that miR-31 represses the translation of Tollip mRNA in S-IECs.

We field tested whether these alternative successional trajectories correlated with alternative plant-soil interactions. In temporally stable patches, we found negative plant-soil feedbacks, where plants grew worse with conspecific than heterospecific soil biota-a mechanism that maintains stability in mathematical models. In contrast, feedbacks in temporally dynamic patches were neutral to positive. Importantly, the magnitude of feedbacks depended on plant frequency, enabling plant species to increase in cover when rare, which theory predicts will promote long-term, stable coexistence.

Once the shaking is over, the excess pore water pressures that developed during the earthquake gradually dissipate, while the surface of the soil settles, in a process called post-liquefaction reconsolidation. When examining reconsolidation, the soil is typically divided in liquefied and solidified parts, which are modelled separately. The aim of this paper is to show that this fragmentation is not necessary. By assuming that the hydraulic conductivity and the one-dimensional stiffness of liquefied sand have real, positive values, the equation of consolidation can be numerically solved throughout a reconsolidating layer. Predictions made in this manner show good agreement with geotechnical centrifuge experiments.

Subsequent rehydration, even after an extended period of time (e.g., weeks), devitrifies sugar--releasing the cargo and unmasking the substrate surface--thus triggering substrate-mediated vesicle fusion in real time, producing supported membranes.

The paper describes the development of a rapid method to determine the viability of cysts of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella using staining with SYTOX Green and flow-cytometric analysis. The viability of A. catenella cysts was inversely proportional to their ability to take up the stain. There was excellent agreement between cysts measured as viable/non-viable using flow cytometry and cyst viability determined in standard long-term germination tests. Advantages of the flow-cytometric method include high test precision and rapid testing times of < 2 days, compared to > 4 weeks using existing germination methods.'", "output": "{\n  \"paraphrase_corpus\": \"The unintentional movement and spread of alien marine species through ship ballast water is becoming an environmental issue of growing concern.

Compared to other techniques, this culture method yields a higher number of pure adult ScC in a significantly reduced time frame, typically two to three times faster. The harvested ScC were used to observe age-related variances in their attachment, proliferation, and survival when cultured in a serum-free environment. The findings showed that adult ScC demonstrated similar attachment capabilities to type I collagen and polylysine as newborn ScC. Nonetheless, collagen was found to support the growth and survival of adult ScC, in contrast to neonatal ScC.

Subsequent studies on Ostm1's subcellular distribution revealed its presence in the endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi network, and endosomes/lysosomes. Through extensive protein screening under physiological conditions, we identified and confirmed several new cytosolic partners of Ostm1. Among these, a direct binding with the kinesin 5B heavy chains was established. These findings suggest that Ostm1 integrates into a cytosolic scaffolding multiprotein complex, serving an adaptor role. Further, the Ostm1/KIF5B complex was found to play a crucial part in the intracellular movement and distribution of cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum to the late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. These insights into the molecular and cellular roles of Ostm1 help clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the broad phenotypic variation seen in Ostm1-deficient mice.\", \"named_entities\": [\"Ostm1\", \"osteopetrosis\", \"N-glycosylated\", \"endoplasmic reticulum\", \"trans-Golgi network\", \"endosomes/lysosomes\", \"kinesin 5B heavy chains\"]}", "prompt_tokens": 1007, "completion_tokens": 367, "total_tokens": 1374}

The histone H5 promoter has binding sites for Sp1 (a high affinity site) and UPE-binding protein, while the 3' erythroid-specific enhancer has binding sites for Sp1 (one moderate and three weak affinity), GATA-1, and NF1. In this study we investigated whether trans-acting factors that bind to the chicken histone H5 promoter or enhancer are associated with adult chicken immature and mature erythrocyte nuclear matrices. We show that NF1, but not Sp1, GATA-1, or UPE-binding protein, is associated with the internal nuclear matrices of these erythroid cells. Further, we found that a subset of the NF1 family of proteins is bound to the mature erythrocyte nuclear matrix. These results suggest that in chicken erythrocytes NF1 may mediate an interaction between the histone H5 enhancer and the erythroid internal nuclear matrix. NF1 was also present in the internal nuclear matrices of chicken liver and trout liver. The observations of this study provide evidence that NF1 may have a role in a variety of cell types in targeting specific DNA sequences to the nuclear matrix.'", "output": "{\"paraphrase_corpus\": \"Chicken histone H5, resembling the H1 linker histone, is uniquely produced in nucleated erythrocytes.

Optimisation procedures include adjustment of the fluoroscopy equipment such as exposure factors as well as proper use of automatic brightness control and pulsed fluoroscopy.

Factors such as magnification levels, additional filtration, the employment of last-image-hold features, and the use of grids also play a critical role in balancing image quality with radiation dose. The radiation dose received by medical personnel is directly linked to the patient's dose since it predominantly originates from radiation scattered off the patient. By adopting proper techniques and radiation shielding devices, the exposure to staff can be greatly reduced to safe levels, even during complex procedures.
