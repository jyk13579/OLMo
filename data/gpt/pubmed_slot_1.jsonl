This sequence is required for nuclear localization of Cln3p and is sufficient to confer nuclear localization to green fluorescent protein in a RAN-dependent manner. Mislocalized Cln3p, lacking the NLS, is much less active in genetic assays specific for Cln3p, but more active in assays normally specific for Cln2p, consistent with the idea that Cln3p localization explains a significant part of Clnp functional specificity.'", "output": "{\"paraphrase_corpus\": \"In budding yeast, different G(1) cyclins bestow distinct functionalities upon the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28p. The Cln3p G(1) cyclin predominantly resides in the nucleus, whereas Cln2p is mainly found in the cytoplasm. The processes of binding to Cdc28p and Cdc28p-mediated phosphorylation at the C-terminal of Cln2p are both essential for Cln2p's efficient removal from the nucleus, indicating that this mechanism might be under physiological regulation. The build-up of less phosphorylated Cln2 in the nucleus is an energy-requiring process, which apparently does not involve the RAN GTPase. In small, newly formed cells separated by elutriation, phosphorylation of Cln2p is less efficient, and this reduction in phosphorylation is associated with a decreased movement of Cln2p out of the nucleus in these newborn cells. Therefore, Cln2p appears to spend a short time in the nucleus at the beginning of the cell cycle. However, the nuclear presence of Cln3p is not affected by Cdk activity. The nuclear location of Cln3p is dependent on a two-part nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the protein's C-terminal, which is necessary for Cln3p's nuclear presence and can also direct green fluorescent protein to the nucleus in a RAN-dependent way. Mislocated Cln3p, missing the NLS, reveals reduced effectiveness in genetic tests designed for Cln3p but displays increased activity in tests usually specific for Cln2p.

The impact of RDT on IOP seems to hinge on a complex interplay involving an increase in IOP as waste product concentrations drop and extracellular volume decreases due to ultrafiltration.

While overexpression of miR-101 did not influence the accumulation of doxorubicin, it promoted the apoptosis-inducing effect of doxorubicin in HepG2 cells. A bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR-101 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), which was verified by a luciferase reporter assay. Finally, transfection of HepG2 cells with Mcl-1 expression plasmid inhibited apoptosis caused by doxorubicin plus miR-101 expression.

This gene duplication aligns with the emergence of sophisticated multi-organ development in these organisms. Among these, PI3KÎ± and PI3KÎ², coded by the genes PIK3CA and PIK3CB respectively, are expressed across a broad range of tissues. They display similar structural domains and share a preference for the PI(4,5)P2 lipid as a substrate. A decade and a half since the introduction of the first selective inhibitors and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) designed to specifically inhibit these isoforms, a review of accumulated insights highlights their overlapping and unique functions.

Sex ratios from progeny testing of sex-reversed males (1âˆ¶3) and most sex-reversed females (1âˆ¶0) provide evidence for female heterogamety in O. aureus. Several aberrant ratios observed suggest Mendelian inheritance of an autosomal recessive gene (F,f), epistatic to the major sex-determining gene (W,Z). Sex ratios of triploids and gynogens support the hypothesis of recombination between the centromere and the major sex-determining locus. Progeny testing of a female mitogyne demonstrated the viability of a novel WW \"superfemale\", which gave only female offspring. Not all data could be explained by a two-factor model of sex determination. Further exceptional sex ratios may be accounted for by rare autosomal or environmental sex-modifying factors.

Crossing O. aureus with O. mossambicus, O. spilums, and O. niloticus led to widely differing sex ratios, indicating a complex nature of sex determination in these hybrids. The data from these hybrids offered limited insights into the sex determination process within the species. Sex ratios derived from the offspring of sex-reversed males (1:3) and the majority of sex-reversed females (1:0) indicated that female heterogamety might be present in O. aureus. The presence of some unusual ratios hinted at the Mendelian inheritance of a recessive autosomal gene (F,f) that interacts epistatically with a principal sex-determining gene (W,Z). The sex ratios in triploids and gynogens lent support to the theory that recombination occurs between the centromere and the primary sex-determining site. Testing the progeny of a mitogyne female revealed the successful production of a WW 'superfemale', capable of producing solely female descendants. Not all findings could be accounted for by a simple two-gene model of sex determination, suggesting that exceptional sex ratios might result from uncommon autosomal or environmental factors influencing sex.

Once the shaking is over, the excess pore water pressures that developed during the earthquake gradually dissipate, while the surface of the soil settles, in a process called post-liquefaction reconsolidation. When examining reconsolidation, the soil is typically divided in liquefied and solidified parts, which are modelled separately. The aim of this paper is to show that this fragmentation is not necessary. By assuming that the hydraulic conductivity and the one-dimensional stiffness of liquefied sand have real, positive values, the equation of consolidation can be numerically solved throughout a reconsolidating layer. Predictions made in this manner show good agreement with geotechnical centrifuge experiments.

We demonstrate an annual gene flow/mortality cycle in cline populations whereby gene frequencies after mortality are correlated with salinity and enzyme activity. The cline is spatially and temporally unstable in immigrants, but stable in residents after mortality. Mortality is nonrandom with regard to the Lap locus; genotype-dependent properties of the aminopeptidase enzyme apparently led to a differential rate of the utilizaiton of nutrient reserves because selected genotypes exhibited an increased rate of tissue weight loss.

These interactions occur throughout the GI tract, from the mouth to the colon. Factors influencing how proteins engage with the GI tract, depending on their source, include their physico-chemical attributes, amino acid content and order, bioactive peptides, rate of digestion, and associated non-protein bioactive substances. Within the GI tract, the digested products interact with receptors to release hormones, impact stomach emptying and GI mobility and absorption, send neural signals to the brain, and alter the gut microflora. This review focuses on how dietary proteins' digestion and absorption interact with the GI tract's functions, highlighting the significance of these interactions in managing amino acid, glucose, lipid metabolism, and influencing dietary intake.\", \"named_entities\": [\"Dietary proteins\", \"amino acids\", \"protein synthesis\", \"glucose and lipid metabolism\", \"blood pressure\", \"bone metabolism\", \"immune function\", \"gastrointestinal (GI) tract\", \"bioactive peptides\", \"digestion kinetics\"]}", "prompt_tokens": 948, "completion_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 1236}

Subsequent rehydration, even after an extended period of time (e.g., weeks), devitrifies sugar--releasing the cargo and unmasking the substrate surface--thus triggering substrate-mediated vesicle fusion in real time, producing supported membranes.

The toxicity of 70% EtOH extract is considerably higher than that of other extracts. Secondly, 70% EtOH extract was subjected to macroporous resin (DM-8) eluting with a gradient of water and EtOH (H<sub>2</sub>O, 25% EtOH, 40% EtOH and 95% EtOH) to give four components (A-D). The toxicity of the component (D) showed higher than the other components (A-C). Thus, the component (D) was taken more attentions to research. Lastly, study on the chemical constituents of the component (D), 27 compounds, including 7 anthraquinones (1-7), 8 stilbenes (8-15), 7 anthrones (16-22), 3 cinnamic acid amides (23-25), 2 naphthols (26-27) were isolated and assessed in zebrafish embryos.

The likelihood of a negative outcome was closely linked to the more extreme forms of oligohydramnios; notably, 88% of cases classified as severe or anhydramniotic resulted in death, in contrast to 11% in the mild to moderate category. The worst outcomes were observed in cases where severe oligohydramnios was coupled with an anuric urinary tract disorder, which invariably led to fatality. In comparison, pulmonary hypoplasia was present in 60% of severe cases, but only 6% of moderate cases. The study concludes that the subjective assessment of oligohydramnios severity by skilled observers is a reliable method that can predict the potential outcome. The discovery of severe oligohydramnios in the second trimester strongly indicates a poor prognosis for the fetus, prompting a detailed investigation into the cause and consideration of possible interventions.

There is a lack of correlation between changes in V1bR mRNA and the number of VP binding sites, suggesting that V1bR expression depends on the efficiency of V1b R mRNA translation into protein. Two mechanisms by which the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the rat V1bR mRNA can mediate either inhibition or activation of V1bR mRNA translation have been identified. First, upstream open reading frames (ORF) present in the 5'-UTR repress translation of the major ORF encoding the V1b receptor, and secondly, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activates V1bR translation. Stimulation of IRES activity through protein kinase C-mediated pathways results in V1bR mRNA translation increasing V1bR protein levels. The existence of multiple loci of regulation for the V1bR at transcriptional and translational levels provides a mechanism to facilitate plasticity of regulation of the number of pituitary vasopressin receptors according to physiological demand.'", "output": "{\"paraphrase_corpus\": \"In rats, the quantity of V1b vasopressin receptors (V1bR) located in the anterior pituitary is crucial for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis's adaptation to stress. The control over V1bR numbers involves both transcriptional and translational processes. A key element for the transcriptional activation of the V1bR gene in rats is the presence of a long sequence of GAGA repeats (GAGA box) in the promoter region close to the start of transcription, which binds to a 127 kDa protein complex found in pituitary nuclear extracts. There's a noted discrepancy between the levels of V1bR mRNA and the quantity of vasopressin binding sites, indicating that V1bR production is more reliant on the efficiency of translating V1bR mRNA into its protein form. Two ways the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) of V1bR mRNA affects its translation have been discovered: repression by upstream open reading frames (ORF) in the 5'-UTR and activation through an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Enhanced IRES function, driven by protein kinase C pathways, leads to increased translation of V1bR mRNA and thus higher levels of the V1bR protein.
