The adhesive behavior arises from strong solid-liquid interactions. This is a chemical reaction free adhesive (no curing time) that can be repeatedly used and is capable of instantaneously joining a large number of diverse materials (metals, ceramic, and polymer) in air and underwater. The current work is a significant advance in the development of amphibious multifunctional adhesives and presents potential applications in a range of sealing applications, including medical ones.",

The unique adhesive qualities emerge from the robust interactions between the solid and liquid components. Unlike traditional adhesives, this one does not require a chemical reaction to set (eliminating cure time), allowing for its repeated use. It can instantly bond various materials together, including metals, ceramics, and polymers, both in atmospheric conditions and underwater. This research marks a considerable progression in crafting adhesives that perform in both terrestrial and aquatic environments, showing promise for diverse sealing tasks, particularly in the medical field.",

Participants included 243 children (M = 4.6 years) and their parents across two annual measurement occasions. Temperamental constructs of frustration proneness, approach, positive affect, activity level, and effortful control were assessed through multiple methods, informants, and contexts. Behavioral observations of children's responses to interparental conflict at each wave yielded four profiles: secure (i.e., efficiently address direct threat), mobilizing (i.e., vigilance to potential threat and social opportunities), dominant (i.e., directly defeat threat), and demobilizing (i.e., reduce salience as a target of hostility). Results supported hypotheses on the distinct constellations of temperament in predicting subsequent change in the four security profiles.",

The study involved 243 children, averaging 4.6 years old, along with their parents, over two yearly assessment periods. It evaluated temperamental traits such as the tendency towards frustration, sociability, positivity, level of activity, and self-regulation using a variety of methods, sources, and settings. Observations of how children dealt with conflicts between their parents identified four distinct behavioral patterns: secure (i.e., effectively confronting immediate threats), mobilizing (i.e., alertness to possible threats and social openings), dominant (i.e., overtly overcoming threats), and demobilizing (i.e., minimizing their visibility as a target for aggression). The findings confirmed the theory's predictions that specific combinations of temperamental attributes could forecast changes in these four profiles of security response over time.",

        "original_corpus": "Medial patellar luxation is defined as medial displacement of the patella from the trochlear groove. In dogs, medial luxations account for 75% of all patellar luxation cases, and are frequently associated with patella alta. Common surgical treatments for medial luxation are trochleoplasty and lateral transposition of the crest to drive the patella into the correct anatomical alignment. Postoperative complications for this procedure are estimated to be between 18-29% of cases, with up to 48% of complications involving reluxation. It was previously hypothesized that in cases of medial luxation involving patella alta, the addition of a distal component to the lateral tibial crest transposition will result in repositioning of the patella into its proper position in the trochlear groove, thus reducing the recurrence of luxation. We performed this modified procedure on 14 dogs (17 limbs) that were suffering from medial luxation combined with patella alta, and our results led to favourable clinical outcomes. This modified surgical procedure places the patella into a more normal proximo-distal anatomical position, is simple to perform, and may become common practice for surgical treatment of medial patellar luxation with an alta component.",
        "paraphrase_corpus": "Medial patellar luxation refers to the inward movement of the kneecap from its natural groove. In dogs, this condition represents 75% of kneecap dislocation cases and often occurs alongside an elevated kneecap. The primary surgical interventions for this disorder include reshaping the groove in which the kneecap sits and moving the attachment of the thigh muscle to help align the kneecap properly. The rate of post-surgery issues is reported to be between 18-29%, with almost half of these cases experiencing a dislocation again. It was theorized that for dogs with an elevated kneecap and medial dislocation, adding a lower component to the muscle attachment transfer can help in correctly positioning the kneecap in its groove, therefore decreasing the chances of dislocation happening again. This new technique was applied to 14 dogs (17 limbs) with both medial luxation and an elevated kneecap, showing promising clinical results. The technique, which aims to place the kneecap in a more naturally aligned position from top to bottom, is straightforward to execute and might become a standard approach for treating medial patellar luxation, especially when an elevated kneecap is also present.",
