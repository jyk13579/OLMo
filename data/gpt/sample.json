  "answer": "adipocyte plasma membranes",
  "original_corpus": "Antibodies were prepared in sheep against purified plasma membranes from pig adipocytes. Western (immuno) blotting revealed reactions of the antisera with a large number of proteins in adipocyte plasma membranes but remarkably few in plasma membranes from muscle, kidney, liver, lung, brain, spleen, and erythrocytes. This illustrated the high degree of specificity the serum had for adipose tissue. When injected into localized subcutaneous sites such antisera were able to cause considerable adipocyte destruction, which resulted in complete loss of adipose tissue from the site for > or = 14 wk. This cell destruction was probably mediated in part by lymphocytic infiltration. Subcutaneous injections were of limited use because of the localized nature of the effects, but, when treatment was administered intraperitoneally, systemic effects were produced that resulted in a 30% reduction in backfat thickness in the region of the last rib and a 25% reduction in fat content of fore- and hind-loin joints that resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of lean tissue. Total feed intake, live weight gain, hot carcass weights, and dressing percentage were unaffected. These results demonstrate the potential for producing long-term reductions in body fat in pigs by an immunization technique that may also provide the unexpected, potential benefit of increased lean deposition. This suggests that fat deposition per se exerts a restrictive influence on lean carcass development.",
  "paraphrase_corpus": "Sheep were immunized to create antibodies targeting the purified plasma membranes from pig adipocytes. Western blot analysis showed that these antibodies reacted with numerous proteins in the adipocyte plasma membranes, yet displayed minimal interaction with proteins from plasma membranes of muscle, kidney, liver, lung, brain, spleen, and erythrocytes. This indicated a high specificity of the serum for adipose tissue. When these antibodies were administered into specific subcutaneous areas, they led to significant adipocyte destruction, resulting in the total disappearance of fat at the injection site for at least 14 weeks. The destruction of these cells was likely aided by lymphocytic infiltration. Subcutaneous administration showed limited utility due to its localized impact, but systemic effects were observed when the treatment was given intraperitoneally. This systemic application caused a 30% decrease in backfat thickness near the last rib and a 25% reduction in fat content in the fore- and hind-loin cuts, leading to a notable rise in lean tissue proportion. Despite these changes in body composition, total feed consumption, live weight gain, hot carcass weights, and dressing percentages remained stable. These findings highlight the capability of this immunization approach to achieve sustained body fat reduction in pigs and suggest a possible additional benefit of enhancing lean tissue accumulation, indicating that fat layers may restrict lean tissue growth in carcasses.",

  "answer": "ELISpot",
  "original_corpus": "According to preliminary data, seroconversion after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination might be unsatisfactory in Kidney Transplant Recipients (KTRs). However, it is unknown if seronegative patients develop at least a cellular response that could offer a certain grade of protection against SARS-CoV-2. To answer this question, we prospectively studied 148 recipients of either kidney (133) or kidney-pancreas (15) grafts with assessment of IgM/IgG spike (S) antibodies and ELISpot against the nucleocapside (N) and the S protein at baseline and 2\u00a0weeks after receiving the second dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. At baseline, 31 patients (20.9%) had either IgM/IgG or ELISpot positivity and were considered to be SARS-CoV-2-pre-immunized, while 117 (79.1%) patients had no signs of either cellular or humoral response and were considered SARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve. After vaccination, na\u00efve patients who developed either humoral or cellular response were finally 65.0%, of which 29.9% developed either IgG or IgM and 35.0% S-ELISpot positivity. Factors associated with vaccine unresponsiveness were diabetes and treatment with antithymocytes globulins during the last year. Side effects were consistent with that of the pivotal trial and no DSAs developed after vaccination. In conclusion, mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicits either cellular or humoral response in almost two thirds of KTRs.",
  "paraphrase_corpus": "Initial findings suggest that the immune response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in Kidney Transplant Recipients (KTRs) may be inadequate, with uncertain cellular protection against the virus. This study closely monitored 148 individuals, comprising 133 kidney and 15 kidney-pancreas transplant recipients, evaluating their IgM/IgG spike (S) antibodies and ELISpot responses to the nucleocapside (N) and S protein before and two weeks post the second dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. Initially, 20.9% of participants showed signs of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, while 79.1% displayed no immune response and were categorized as naive to the virus. Post-vaccination, 65% of the previously naive group developed an immune response, with 29.9% showing IgG or IgM antibodies and 35% demonstrating S-ELISpot positivity. Factors like diabetes and recent antithymocyte globulin therapy were linked to poor vaccine response. Reported side effects aligned with those in the main study, and no donor-specific antibodies emerged post-vaccination. In conclusion, the mRNA-1273 vaccine stimulated an immune response in nearly two-thirds of KTRs, either through antibody or cellular pathways.",
